    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>Malto Speech and Transcripts, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number 
  LDC2012S04 and ISBN 1-58563-606-1, was developed by Masato Kobayashi, Associate 
  Professor in Linguistics at the University of Tokyo (Japan), and Bablu Tirkey, 
  research scholar at the Tribal and Regional Languages Department, Ranchi University 
  (India). It contains approximately 8 hours of Malto speech data collected 
  between 2005 and 2009 from 27 speakers (22 males, 5 females). Also included are accompanying 
  transcripts, English translations and glosses for 6 hours of the collection. Speakers were 
  asked to talk about themselves, their lives, rituals and folklore; elicitation 
  interviews were then conducted. The goal of the work was to present the current 
  state and dialectal variation of Malto.</p>
  
<p>Malto is a Dravidian language spoken in northeastern India (principally the 
  states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal) and Bangladesh by people called 
  the Pahariyas. Indian census data places the number of Malto speakers in a range 
  of between 100,000-200,000 total speakers. Most Malto speakers live in the three 
  northeastern districts of Jharkhand, i.e, Sahebganj, Godda and Pakur; the fieldwork 
  that resulted in this corpus was conducted in those districts. Of the Pahariyas 
  in that area, three subtribes, the Sawriya Pahariyas, the Mal Pahariyas and 
  the Kumarbhag Pahariyas, primarily speak Malto. (Kobayashi 3) </p>
  
<p> Pahariya villages or hamlets are located on hilly tracts and in the lowlands 
  are often separated by non-Parahiya villages. As a result, Malto varies from 
  village to village. It may be more accurate to consider Malto a continuum of 
  dialects rather than a unitary language. The three major dialects -- Sawriya 
  Pahariya, Mal Pahariya, and Kumarbhag Pahariya -- correspond to the principal 
  sub-tribal communities. (Kobayashi 14)</p>

<p>For further reading on Malto, consult <i>Texts and Grammar of Malto</i>  (2012) by 
  Masato Kobayashi published by Kotoba Books, Vizianagaram 2012 and sold by the book distributors: Mary Martin Booksellers,

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The transcribed data accounts for 6 hours of the collection and contain 21 speakers
(17 male, 4 female). The untranscribed data accounts for 2 hours of the collection and contains 
10 speakers (9 male, 1 female). Four of the male speakers are present in both groups.</p>
<p>All audio is presented in .wav format. Each audio file name includes a subject 
  number, village name, speaker name and the topic discussed. The transcripts 
  and glossary are UTF-8 text files. Because of ambiguities that occur when writing 
  Malto in Devenagari script, the transcripts were developed using Roman script 
  with symbols adapted from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) but are 
  not considered to be phonetic transcripts.</p> 
<p>Consult <a href="./docs/readme.txt">docs/readme.txt</a> and 
<a href ="./docs/untran_speaker.txt">docs/untran_speaker.txt</a>
for further information 
  about the corpus, its collection and the speakers. The transcription and glosses 
  are split into three text files; consult the <a href="./docs/readme.txt">readme</a> 
  to determine which audio files are covered by each transcript.</p>
