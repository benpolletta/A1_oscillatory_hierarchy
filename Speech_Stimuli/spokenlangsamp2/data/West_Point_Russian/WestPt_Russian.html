    	<h3>Introduction</h3> 

    	
<p>This file contains information on, and samples of, West Point Russian Speech, 
  Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2003S05 and ISBN 1-58563-277-5. 
<p> West Point Russian Speech was developed at the Department of Foreign Languages 
  (DFL) and the Center for Technology Enhanced Language Learning (CTELL) at the 
  United States Military Academy at West Point. The purpose of the corpus is to 
  provide a set of recordings for the training and development of speaker-independent 
  speech recognition systems for use by West Point cadets enrolled in the Russian 
  language program. 
<h3>Data</h3>

	
<p>The full corpus consists of 4,181 speech files in SPHERE format, totalling 
  approximately 4 hours of speech. Four samples are presented here.

<p>The speech data was collected using laptop computers running Windows NT. Recordings 
  were captured at a sampling rate of 16 bit at 22050 Hz pcm using a Shure SM10A 
  microphone and a RANE Model MS1 pre-amplifier. A visual display of the sentence, 
  along with a digital recording of the sentence as read by a native speaker, 
  was presented. The informant pressed the Enter key to record the utterance. 
  The informant's recording was played back for review, and the utterance was 
  re-recorded if necessary. 
<p>The collection script consists of 96 sentences with a total of 528 tokens and 351 types.  The prompts are labeled "s01" through "s96".
