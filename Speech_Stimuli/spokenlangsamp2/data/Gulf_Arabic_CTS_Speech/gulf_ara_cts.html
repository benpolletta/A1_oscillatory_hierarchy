    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains documentation for samples from Gulf Arabic Conversational 
  Telephone Speech and Transcripts, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog numbers 
  LDC2006S43 (speech) and LDC2006T15 (transcripts) and isbns 1-58563-400-X and 
  1-58563-401-8, respectively. 
<p>Gulf Arabic is the colloquial Arabic dialect spoken in nations on or near the 
  Persian Gulf. The dialect is characterized by the presence of loanwords from 
  Persian and idiosyncratic pronounciation that sets it apart both from Modern 
  Standard Arabic (MSA) and from other Arabic dialects. </p>
<p>Gulf Arabic Conversational Telephone Speech is a database of 975 spontaneous 
  telephone conversations in Colloquial Gulf Arabic. A total of 976 conversation 
  sides are provided (one speaker appears on two distinct calls). The average 
  duration per side is about 5.7 minutes.</p>
<p>The data was collected and transcribed in 2004 by Appen Pty Ltd. (Appen), Sydney, 
  Australia.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>

    
<p>Presented below are three two-minute audio samples in MS Wave format (.wav) 
  along with their associated transcriptions. The recordings have two channels, 
  each of represents one side of the conversation. In the full corpus, the audio 
  files were recorded using the NIST Sphere audio format.

<h3>Transcript Format</h3>

<p>Each transcript file is a tab-delimited flat table, where each line
contains information and text for a single contiguous utterance,
presented via the following fields:</p>

<ol>
 <li> beginning time stamp in seconds, in square brackets ("[5.7189]")
 <li> ending time stampe in seconds, in square brackets
 <li> channel/speaker-ID ("A:" or "B:")
 <li> "consonant skeleton" orthography for the utterance, in UTF-8
 <li> "diacritized" orthography for the utterance, in ASCII
</ol>

<p>The ASCII field is the Buckwalter transliteration of the fully
"vowelized" (pronunciation) form of the utterance.  Within fields 4
and 5, word boundaries are marked by space characters in the normal
way, following common practices of Arabic orthographic convention
(e.g. all definite articles and many conjunctions and prepositions are
attached as prefixes to the following word).</p>

<p>Transcript tokens enclosed in single parentheses -- e.g. "(DHk)" --
represent annotation marks for non-speech events or conditions, such
as laughter, noise, etc.  Multi-token strings within single
parentheses involve words in some other language (typically English)
or some other Arabic dialect.</p>

<p>Double parentheses, either with or without tokens enclosed within them -- e.g. 
  "(())", "((word))" or "((word1 word2))" -- represent regions where the transcriber 
  was unsure as to what was said.</p>

<p>The "consonant skeleton" orthography is intended to reflect common orthographic 
  practice in written Arabic (i.e. MSA), but without being bound strictly by the 
  specific spellings of MSA words. That is, there may be novel (dialect-specific) 
  words and changes of consonant quality (hence altered spelling) in words that 
  are cognates between MSA and Gulf Arabic.</p>

<p>The "vowelized" orthography is restricted to a character set that
allows words to be rendered coherently in Arabic script (with all
diacritics present as needed to represent short vowels, etc), but is
intended to reflect the perceived pronunciation of each token.  As a
result, a given word (type), having a multiple occurrences in the text
with identical "skeletal" spellings, may have multiple distinct
"vowelized" spellings.  In some cases, these different spellings
simply reflect pronunciation variants, while in other cases, they
represent distinct morphological forms (with distinct contextual
meanings) where the semantic differences are conveyed solely by the
the short vowels (i.e. the diacritics).</p>
