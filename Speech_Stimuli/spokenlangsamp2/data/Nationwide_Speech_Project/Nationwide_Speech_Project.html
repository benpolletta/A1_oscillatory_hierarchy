    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains information on and samples for Nationwide Speech Project, 
  Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2007S15 and isbn 1-58563-449-2. 
<p>This corpus represents part of the work of the Nationwide Speech Project (NSP) 
  conducted by the authors at Indiana University. The purpose of the NSP was to 
  collect a large amount of speech produced by male and female talkers representing 
  the primary regional varieties of American English: New England, Mid-Atlantic, 
  North, Midland, South and West. This release contains nearly one hour of speech 
  from 60 white American English speakers --including five male and five female 
  talkers from the six dialect regions -- reading words and sentences. The corpus 
  can be used for perceptual and acoustic experiments designed to explore the 
  role of variation in spoken language processing. Such applications include speech 
  science experiments and sociolinguistic or sociophonetic research. This corpus 
  is fully described in <a href="./docs/clopper_sc06.pdf"STYLE="text-decoration:none">The 
  Nationwide Speech Project: A new corpus of American English dialects. </a></p>




    <h3>Data</h3>


   
<p> The speakers were recruited from the Indiana University community; they were 
  all 18-25 years old at the time of recording, had lived exclusively in one region 
  prior to age 18, and both parents of each speaker were also raised in the same 
  region. Further demographic information about the speakers is provided in the 
  file talkers.txt. The materials include 102 high predictability sentences and 
  five repetitions of each of 10 hVd words. The high predictability sentences 
  are 5-8 words in length and the final word in each sentence is highly predictable 
  based on the preceding semantic context. The 10 hVd words are: heed, hid, hayed, 
  hedad, had, hod, hud, hoes, hood and who'd. </p>
<p>Participants were recorded one at a time by an experimenter in a sound attenuated 
  booth (IAC Audiometric Testing Room, Model 402). Both the experimenter and the 
  participant sat in the sound booth during testing. During the recording session, 
  the participant was seated in front of a ViewSonic LCD flatscreen monitor (ViewPanel 
  VG151) which mirrored the screen of a Macintosh Powerbook G3 laptop. The participant 
  wore a Shure head-mounted microphone (SM10A) that was positioned approximately 
  one inch from the left corner of the talker&#39;s mouth. The microphone output 
  was fed to an Applied Research Technology microphone tube pre-amplifier. The 
  output gain on the pre-amplifier was adjusted by the experimenter while the 
  participant read the Grandfather Passage as a warm-up before recording began. 
  The output of the microphone pre-amplifier was connected to a Roland UA-30 USB 
  audio interface which digitized the signal and transmitted it via USB ports 
  to the laptop where each utterance was recorded in an individual AIFF 16-bit 
  digital sound file at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz (converted to .wav format 
  files for this release) The experimenter held the laptop on her lap and wore 
  headphones connected to the Roland device so that she could hear the same audio 
  signal that was being input to the laptop for recording.</p>

    
<p>Presented here are four samples of speakers reading one of the project sentences: 
  &quot;A bicycle has two wheels.&quot; Each of the speakers comes from a distinct 
  dialect region. </p>
