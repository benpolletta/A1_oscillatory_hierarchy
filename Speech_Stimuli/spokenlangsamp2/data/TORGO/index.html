<h1>TORGO Database of Dysarthric Articulation</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2012S02</h3>


    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>TORGO Database of Dysarthric Articulation, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) 
  catalog number LDC2012S02 and ISBN 1-58563-603-7, was developed by the University 
  of Toronto's departments of <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/Page4.aspx">Computer 
  Science </a> and <a href ="http://www.slp.utoronto.ca/Page13.aspx">Speech Language 
  Pathology</a> in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.hollandbloorview.ca/">Holland-Bloorview 
  Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a> in Toronto, Canada. It contains approximately 
  23 hours of English speech data, accompanying transcripts and documentation 
  from 8 speakers (5 males, 3 females) with cerebral palsy (CP) or amyotrophic 
  lateral sclerosis (ALS) and from 7 speakers (4 males, 3 females) from a non-dysarthric 
  control group. </p>
<p>CP and ALS are examples of dysarthria which is caused by disruptions in the 
  neuro-motor interface that distort motor commands to the vocal articulators, 
  resulting in atypical and relatively unintelligible speech in most cases. The 
  TORGO database is primarily a resource for developing advanced automatic speaker 
  recognition (ASR) models suited to the needs of people with dysarthria, but it 
  is also applicable to non-dysarthric speech. The inability of modern ASR to 
  effectively understand dysarthric speech is a problem since the more general 
  physical disabilities often associated with the condition can make other forms 
  of computer input, such as computer keyboards or touch screens, difficult to 
  use. </p>


<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The data consists of aligned acoustics and measured 3D articulatory features 
  from the speakers carried out using the <a href="http://www.articulograph.de/">3D 
  AG500 electro-magnetic articulograph</a> (EMA) system (Carstens Medizinelektronik 
  GmbH, Lenglern, Germany) with fully-automated calibration. This system allows 
  for 3D recordings of articulatory movements inside and outside the vocal tract, 
  thus providing a detailed window on the nature and direction of speech-related 
  activity.</p>
<p>The data was collected between 2008 and 2010 in Toronto, Canada. All subjects 
  read text consisting of non-words, short words and restricted sentences from 
  a 19-inch LCD screen. The restricted sentences included 162 sentences from the 
  sentence intelligibility section of <em>Assessment of intelligibility of dysarthric 
  speech</em> (Yorkston &amp; Beukelman, 1981) and 460 sentences derived from 
  the <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC93S1">TIMIT</a> 
  database. The unrestricted sentences were elicited by asking participants to 
  spontaneously describe 30 images in interesting situations taken randomly from 
  <em>Webber Photo Cards - Story Starters</em> (Webber, 2005), designed to prompt 
  students to tell or write a story.</p>
<p>Data is organized by speaker and by the session in which each speaker recorded 
  data. Each speaker was assigned a code and given their own file directory. The 
  code for female speakers begins with 'F', and the code for male speakers begins 
  with 'M'. If the speaker was a member of the control group, the letter 'C' follows 
  the gender code. The last two digits of the code indicate the order in which 
  that subject was recruited. For example, speaker 'FC02' was the second female 
  speaker without dysarthria recruited. Note that some speakers were intentionally 
  left out of the data, and thus, there are gaps in the numbering.</p>
<p>Each speaker's directory contains 'Session' directories which encapsulate data 
  recorded in the respective visit and occasionally, a 'Notes' directory which 
  can include Frenchay assessments (test for the measurement, description and 
  diagnosis of dysarthria), notes about sessions (e.g., sensor errors), and other 
  relevant notes.</p>
   
   <p>Each 'Session' directory can, but does not necessarily, contain the following content:</p>
   <ul>
   	<li>alignment.txt: This is a text file containing the sample offsets between audio files
		       recorded simultaneously by the array microphone and the head-worn
		       microphone.</li>
		<li>amps: These directories contain raw *.amp and *.ini files produced by the AG500
	      articulograph.</li>
	      
	  	<li>phn_*: These directories contain phonemic transcriptions of audio data. Each file
	       is plain text with a *.PHN file extensions and a filename referring to the
	       utterance number. These files were generated using the free 
	       <a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/wavesurfer/">Wavesurfer</a> tool.</li>
	   
  		<li> pos: These directories contain the head-corrected positions, velocities, 
    and orientations of sensor coils for each utterance, as generated by the AG500 
    articulograph.</li>
	   <li>prompts: These directories contain orthographic transcriptions.</li>
	   <li>rawpos: These directories are equivalent to the pos directories except that their
		articulographic content is not head-normalized to a constant upright 
		position.</li>
		<li>wav_*: These directories contain the acoustics. Each file is a RIFF (little-endian) 
	       WAVE audio file (Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 16000 Hz).</li>
	   <li>wavall: These directories contains a stereo recording in which one
		channel contains the recorded acoustics and the other channel contains the
		analog peaks associated with the 'sweep' signal, which is used by the AG500
		hardware for synchronization.
		</li>
   </ul>
   
<p> Additionally, sessions recorded with the AG500 articulograph are marked with 
  the file 'EMA', and those recorded with the video-based system are marked with 
  the file 'VIDEO'. Files with a date form as the filename and a txt extension 
  (e.g. april232008cal2.txt, jan28cal3.txt) are 
  the measured responses from calibration. The *.log and *.calset files contain descriptions
  of the calibration process, but not the final result of calibration.</p>
  
	<p>See the <a href="docs/README.txt">readme</a> file and the 
	<a href="http://wiki.ag500.net">AG500 Wiki</a> for more complete descriptions of the 
	possible subfolders and of the AG500 specific files. 
	Also, see <a href="docs/session_contents.tsv">session_contents.tsv</a> for a 
	tab separated table of each session's subfolders and metadata files.</p>
   
    
    <h3>Directory Structure</h3>

    <p>Please see <a href="docs/file.tbl">file.tbl</a> for a complete file list as well as checksums for
      this publication.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="data/">data/</a> - Contains the sessions and notes directories for each speaker.
  Subdivided as above.
  <li><a href="docs/">docs/</a> - Contains documentation about the corpus, a manual for the tapadm 
  toolbox and a file table.
  <li><a href="tools/">tools/</a> - Contains Matlab function useful in analysing the TORGO data. 
  generateAlignTable.m was developed by the corpus authors to generate the 'alignment.txt' 
	files. The tapadm sub-directory contains Matlab code to access the data produced by the
	AG500 electromagnetic articulograph and is also available at 
	<a href=" http://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~andi/EMAPage">
	 http://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~andi/EMAPage</a>. Note that in the 
	 <a href="docs/README.txt">readme</a>, these functions are in the scripts folder. 
  The folder name was changed to align more closely with LDC's directory structure.
</ul>
