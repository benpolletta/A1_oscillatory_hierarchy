    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>Digital Archive of Southern Speech (DASS), Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) 
  catalog number LDC2012S03 and ISBN 1-58563-603-7, was developed by the University 
  of Georgia. It is a subset of the <a href="http://www.lap.uga.edu/Site/LAGS.html">
  Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States</a> (LAGS), 
  which is in turn part of the <a href="http://www.lap.uga.edu/">Linguist Atlas 
  Project</a> (LAP). DASS contains approximately 370 hours of English speech data 
  from 30 female speakers and 34 male speakers in .wav format and in .mp3 format, 
  along with associated metadata about the speakers and the recordings and maps 
  in .jpeg format relating to the recording locations.</p>
<p>LAP consists of a set of survey research projects about the words and pronunciation 
  of everyday American English, the largest project of its kind in the United 
  States. Interviews with thousands of native speakers across the country have 
  been carried out since 1929. LAGS 
  surveyed the everyday speech of Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, 
  Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas in a series of 914 audio-taped interviews conducted 
  from 1968-1983. Interviews average approximately six hours in length; the systematic 
  LAGS tape archive amounts to 5500 hours of sound recordings. DASS is a collection 
  of 64 interviews from LAGS selected to cover a range of speech across the region 
  and to represent multiple education levels and ethnic backgrounds. </p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p> The DASS speakers' average age is 61 years; there are 30 women and 34 men 
  from the Gulf States region represented in this release. The interviews cover 
  common topics such as family, the weather, household articles and activities, 
  agriculture and social connections. </p>
<p>The interviews were originally recorded in the field on reel-to-reel audio 
  tape. A digital version of every reel of tape was then made, one .wav file per 
  reel, usually about one hour of sound. Each interview thus consists of a set 
  of 3 to 13 reels, or roughly 3 to 13 interview hours. Personally identifying 
  or sensitive information in the files was replaced with a tone to protect the 
  privacy and to assure ethical treatment of speakers. Each .wav file is split 
  into multiple .mp3 files based on the topic of conversation and labeled thusly. 
  Included spreadsheets provide information about the speakers, the labels used 
  for topics and the sound files.</p>
<p>Also included in this release is a version of the LICHEN software developed 
  at the University of Oulu, Finland. LICHEN allows users to browse and search 
  through the audio data in a more advanced fashion using a graphical interface. 
  Further information and <a href="docs/instructions_for_using_LICHEN.pdf">instructions</a> 
  for LICHEN can be found within the docs folder of this release. LICHEN requires 
  <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC media player</a> and 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/">java</a> and runs on Windows. To launch LICHEN, run 
  LAUNCH_LICHEN.bat located in the <a href="data/LICHEN/">data/LICHEN/</a> 
  folder.</p>
  <p>In the event that LICHEN reports a file not found error when trying to play a 
  particular audio file, this may be fixed by changing the file name on 
  the hard drive to match the file name listed in LICHEN and within the error message.</p>
<p>Users who wish to use the data from the command line in *NIX systems may experience 
  difficulty as many file names contain spaces and parenthesis. Those characters 
  were left in the file names to ensure that LICHEN runs smoothly. Depending on 
  your particular system, you may be able to utilize 
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html">sed</A> to overcome this. 
  Inserting <CODE>sed 's:\([ ()]\):\\\1:g'</CODE> into your commands should produce 
  escaped spaces and parenthesis and make mass processing feasible. </p>
