<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Asian Elephant Vocalizations, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)
catalog number LDC2010S05 and isbn 1-58563-557-X, consists of 57.5
hours of audio recordings of vocalizations by Asian Elephants
(<i>Elephas maximus</i>) in the Uda Walawe National Park, Sri Lanka,
of which 31.25 hours have been annotated. Voice recording field notes
were made by Shermin de Silva and Ashoka Ranjeewa, of the Uda Walawe
Elephant Research Project. The collection and annotation of the
recordings was conducted and overseen by Shermin de Silva, through the
University of Pennsylvania Department of Biology, and Institute for
Research in Cognitive Science. The recordings primarily feature adult
female, and juvenile elephants. Existing knowledge of acoustic
communication in elephants is based mostly on African species
(<i>Loxodonta africana</i> and <i>Loxodonta cyclotis</i>). There has
been comparatively less study of communication in Asian elephants,
primarily becuase the habitat in which Asian elephants typically live
makes them more difficult to study than African forest elephants. For
other current elephant vocalization research,
see <a href="http://elephantvoices.org/">ElephantVoices</a> and the
Cornell Lab of
Ornithology's <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/elephant/">Elephant
Listening Project</a>.</p>

<p>This corpus is intended to enable researchers in acoustic
communication to evaluate acoustic features and repertoire diversity
of the recorded population.  Of particular interest is whether there
may be regional dialects that differ among Asian elephant populations
in the wild and in captivity.  A second interest is in whether
structural commonalities exist between this and other species that
shed light on underlying social and ecological factors shaping
communication systems.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<h4>Study site and subjects</h4>

<p>Uda Walawe National Park (UWNP), Sri Lanka, is located at latitude
630&deg;14.0646&quot;N, longitude 80&deg;54'28.1268&quot;E, and an
average altitude of 118 m above sea level. It occupies 308
km<sup>2</sup> and contains tall grassland, dense scrub, riparian
forest, secondary forest, rivers and seasonal streams. It also
contains several natural and man-made water sources and reservoirs
with seasonal floodplains. There are two monsoons per calendar year,
separated by dry seasons of variable length. Over 300 adult females
have been individually identified in UWNP using characteristics of the
ears, tail, and other natural markings (Moss, 1996).</p>

<h4>Data collection</h4>

<p>Data were collected from May, 2006 to December, 2007. Observations
were performed by vehicle during park hours from 0600 to 1830
h. Most recordings of vocalizations were made using an Earthworks QTC50
microphone shock-mounted inside a Rycote Zeppelin windshield, via a
Fostex FR-2 field recorder (24-bit sample size, sampling rate 48 kHz)
connected to a 12 V lead acid battery. Recordings were initiated at
the start of a call with a 10-s pre-record buffer so that the entire
call was captured and loss of rare vocalizations minimized.  This was
made possible with the 'pre-record' feature of the Fostex, which
records continuously, but only saves the file with a 10-second lead
once the 'record' button is depressed. In order to minimize loss of
low-frequency or potentially inaudible calls, recording was continued
for at least three minutes following the end of vocalization
events. During the first two months, hour-long recording sessions were
also carried out opportunistically while in close proximity to a
group. However, spectrograms showed that few vocalizations were
captured; therefore, this was discontinued.</p>

<h5>Anomalies</h5> 

<p>Some audio files have 1 channel (field recording)
and some have 2 channels (field recordings and field notes).</p>

<p>Certain
files were recorded at 22050 Hz sample rate: 
<ul>
<li>asian_elephant_voc_d1/data/20070209/B13h00m34s09feb2007y.flac</li>
<li>asian_elephant_voc_d1/data/20070209/B13h10m04s09feb2007y.flac</li>
<li>asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070405/B14h56m48s05apr2007y.flac</li>

<li>asian_elephant_voc_d2/data/20070409/B14h39m27s09apr2007y.flac</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Certain files were recorded at 16 bits per sample:
<ul>
<li>asian_elephant_voc_d1/data/20070209/B13h00m34s09feb2007y.flac</li>
<li>asian_elephant_voc_d1/data/20070209/B13h10m04s09feb2007y.flac</li>

<li>asian_elephant_voc_d5/data/20071024/B16h12m29s24oct2007y.flac</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>One file contains audio extracted from a video recording at 16-bit,
32 kHz.  This file may overlap with other audio recordings, but was
used to aid annotation because of the density of vocalizations and the
number of vocalizing individuals:
<ul>
<li>asian_elephant_voc_d1/data_from_video/20070724/20070724_g01_vocs.flac</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Audio data annotation</h4>

<p>Certain audio files were manually annotated, to the extent
possible, with call type (see below for a list of categories), caller
id, and miscellaneous notes.  Annotations were made using
the <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/TextGridEditor.html">Praat
TextGrid Editor</a>, which allows spectral analysis and annotation of
audio files with overlapping events. Annotations were based on written
and audio-recorded field notes, and in some cases video
recordings. Miscellaneous notes are free-form, and include such
information as distance from source, caller identity certainty, and
accompanying behavior. Audio files that are included without a
corresponding Praat TextGrid annotation file have not yet been
annotated.</p>

<h3>Acoustic features</h3>

<p>There are three main categories of vocalizations: those that show
clear fundamental frequencies (periodic), those that do not
(a-periodic), and those that show periodic and a-periodic regions as
at least two distinct segments. Calls were identified as belonging to
one of 14 categories:
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Call Type</td><td>Abbreviation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Growl</td><td>GRW</td></tr>
<tr><td>Squeak</td><td>SQK</td></tr>
<tr><td>Longroar-rumble</td><td>LRM</td></tr>
<tr><td>Longroar</td><td>LRR</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rumble</td><td>RUM</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bark-rumble</td><td>BRM</td></tr>
<tr><td>Trumpet</td><td>TMP</td></tr>
<tr><td>Roar-rumble</td><td>RRM</td></tr>
<tr><td>Roar</td><td>ROR</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bark</td><td>BRK</td></tr>

<tr><td>Chirp-rumble</td><td>CRM2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Musth chirp-rumble</td><td>MCR</td></tr>

<h3>Audio compression (FLAC)</h3>

<p>All audio wav files in this corpus have been compressed
using <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC (Free Lossless Audio
Codec)</a>.  Becuase FLAC is a lossless compression algorithm, the
conversion of the included FLAC files into wav files will result in
files that are sample-for-sample identical to the original wav file
recordings.</p>

<p>Many standard audio tools (including Praat TextGrid Editor) will
transparently decompress FLAC files, so that they may be played,
processed, and examined as if they were uncompressed audio.  Should
you wish to explicitly decompress FLAC files (by converting them into
wav files), there are many free audio tools capable of performing this
conversion.  Some such tools, available for all major operating
systems, may be found
at <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html">http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html</a></p>
