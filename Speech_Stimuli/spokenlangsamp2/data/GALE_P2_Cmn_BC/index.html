<h1>GALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Speech</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2013S04</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>GALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast Conversation Speech, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2013S04 and ISBN 1-58563-642-8, was developed by LDC 
  and is comprised of approximately 120 hours of Chinese broadcast conversation 
  speech collected in 2006 and 2007 by LDC and Hong University of Science and 
  Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, during Phase 2 of the DARPA GALE (Global Autonomous 
  Language Exploitation) Program.</p>
  <p>Corresponding transcripts are released as GALE Phase 2 Chinese Broadcast 
  Conversation Transcripts
  (<a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2013T08">LDC2013T08</a>).</p>
  
  
<p>Broadcast audio for the GALE program was collected at LDC’s Philadelphia, PA USA facilities
 and at three remote collection sites:  HKUST (Chinese); Medianet, Tunis, Tunisia (Arabic); 
 and MTC, Rabat, Morocco (Arabic). The combined local and outsourced broadcast collection 
 supported GALE at a rate of approximately 300 hours per week of programming from more than 
 50 broadcast sources for a total of over 30,000 hours of collected broadcast audio over the 
 life of the program.</p>
<p>LDC’s local broadcast collection system is highly automated, easily extensible 
  and robust and capable of collecting, processing and evaluating hundreds of 
  hours of content from several dozen sources per day. The broadcast material 
  is served to the system by a set of free-to-air (FTA) satellite receivers, commercial 
  direct satellite systems (DSS) such as DirecTV, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) 
  receivers, and cable television (CATV) feeds. The mapping between receivers 
  and recorders is dynamic and modular; all signal routing is performed under 
  computer control, using a 256x64 A/V matrix switch. Programs are recorded in 
  a high bandwidth A/V format and are then processed to extract audio, to generate 
  keyframes and compressed audio/video, to produce time-synchronized closed captions 
  (in the case of North American English) and to generate automatic speech recognition 
  (ASR) output. An overview of the system, the sources recorded and the configuration 
  of the recording laboratory are contained in the Guidelines for Broadcast Audio 
  Collection Version 3.0 included in this release.</p>
<p>LDC designed a portable platform for remote broadcast collection. This is a 
  TiVO-style digital video recording (DVR) system that records two streams of 
  A/V material simultaneously. It supports analog CATV (NTSC and PAL) and FTA 
  DVB-S satellite programming and can operate outside of the United States. It 
  has a small footprint, weighs less than 30 pounds and can be transported as carry-on 
  luggage. </p>
<p>HKUST collected Chinese broadcast programming using its internal recording 
  system and a portable broadcast collection platform designed by LDC and installed 
  at HKUST in 2006. </p>
    
<h3>Data</h3>
<p> The broadcast conversation recordings in this release feature interviews, call-in programs and 
roundtable discussions focusing principally on current events from the following sources: Anhui TV, 
a regional television station in Mainland China, Anhui Province; China Central TV (CCTV), a national 
and international broadcaster in Mainland China; Hubei TV, a regional broadcaster in Mainland China, 
Hubei Province; and Phoenix TV, a Hong Kong-based satellite television station. A table showing 
  the number of programs and hours recorded from each source is contained in the 
  readme file.</p>
<p>This release contains 202 audio files presented in Waveform Audio File format 
  (.wav), 16000 Hz single-channel 16-bit PCM. Each file was audited by a native 
  Chinese speaker following Audit Procedure Specification Version 2.0 which is 
  included in this release. The broadcast auditing process served three principal 
  goals: as a check on the operation of the broadcast collection system equipment 
  by identifying failed, incomplete or faulty recordings; as an indicator of broadcast 
  schedule changes by identifying instances when the incorrect program was recorded; 
  and as a guide for data selection by retaining information about a program’s 
  genre, data type and topic. </p>
