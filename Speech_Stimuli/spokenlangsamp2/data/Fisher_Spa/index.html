    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>Fisher Spanish - Speech, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog
  number LDC2010T04 and isbn 1-58563-536-7, was developed by LDC and
  consists of audio files covering roughly 163 hours of telephone
  speech from 136 native Caribbean Spanish and non-Caribbean Spanish
  speakers. Full orthographic transcripts of these audio files are
  available in <a
  href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2010T04">Fisher
  Spanish - Transcripts (LDC2010T04)</a>.

<p>The Fisher telephone conversation collection protocol was created at LDC to 
  address a critical need of developers trying to build robust automatic speech 
  recognition (ASR) systems. Previous collection protocols, such as CALLFRIEND 
  and Switchboard-II and the resulting corpora, have been adapted for ASR research 
  but were in fact developed for language and speaker identification respectively. 
  Although the CALLHOME protocol and corpora were developed to support ASR technology, 
  they feature small numbers of speakers making telephone calls of relatively 
  long duration with narrow vocabulary across the collection. CALLHOME conversations 
  are challengingly natural and intimate. Under the Fisher protocol, a very large 
  number of participants each make a few calls of short duration speaking to other 
  participants, whom they typically do not know, about assigned topics. This maximizes 
  inter-speaker variation and vocabulary breadth although it also increases formality. 
<p>Previous protocols such as CALLHOME, CALLFRIEND and Switchboard relied
upon participant activity to drive the collection. Fisher is unique in
being platform driven rather than participant driven. Participants who
wish to initiate a call may do so; however the collection platform
initiates the majority of calls.  Participants need only answer their
phones at the times they specified when registering for the study.

<p>To encourage a broad range of vocabulary, Fisher participants are
asked to speak on an assigned topic which is selected at random from a
list, which changes every 24 hours and which is assigned to all
subjects paired on that day. Some topics are inherited or refined from
previous Switchboard studies while others were developed specifically
for the Fisher protocol.

<p>In collecting data for this corpus, attempts were made to provide a
representative distribution of subjects across a variety of
demographic categories including: gender, age, dialect region, and
education level.

<p>This corpus joins other Fisher corpora: Arabic CTS Levantine

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>The speech recordings consist of 819 telephone conversations of 10 to 12 minutes 
  in duration. They are provided as digital audio files in NIST SPHERE format 
  (1024-byte ASCII file headers). The conversations were recorded as 2-channel 
  mu-law sample data with 8000 samples per second (as captured from the public 
  telephone network). 

<p>The accompanying transcript files (availabel in <a
  href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2010T04">Fisher
  Spanish - Transcripts (LDC2010T04)</a>) are in plain-text, tab-delimited format (tdf) with UTF-8 
  character encoding. They were created with the LDC-developed transcription tool 
  <a
  href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/tools/XTrans/">&quot;XTrans&quot;</a>, which 
  allowed for improved handling of multi-channel audio and overlapping speakers. 
  XTrans is available from LDC. 
<p>Transcribers followed
    LDC's <a href="docs/trans_guide_nqrt_span.doc">Transcription
    Guidelines (NQTR)</a>, which are included with the documentation
    for this release.
<p> The first line of each transcript file provides the column headings; the next 
  two lines are &quot;comments&quot; that can be ignored (these are used by XTrans; they 
  are distinguished from non-comment lines by having an initial semicolon &quot;;&quot;). 
  Actual transcript data, with time stamps, channel number, transcript text and 
  additional information, begins at line 4 of each transcript file. 

<p>Native speakers of Caribbean Spanish and non-Caribbean Spanish were
  recruited from within the continental United States and Puerto
  Rico. The following tables provide an overview of the demographics
  of the participants. The <a
  href="docs/fsp06_subj.tbl">Subjects Table</a> file, provided in the
  documentation, may be used to answer questions about specific
  combinations of participant characteristics (including level of
  participation).
