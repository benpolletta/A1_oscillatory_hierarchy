<h1>USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts English</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2012S05</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts English, LDC Catalog Number LDC2012S05 
  and ISBN 1-58563-602-9, was developed by The University of Southern California's 
  Shoah Foundation Institute (USC-SFI), the University of Maryland, IBM and Johns 
  Hopkins University as part of the <a href="http://malach.umiacs.umd.edu/">MALACH 
  (Multilingual Access to Large Spoken ArCHives) Project</a>. It contains approximately 
  375 hours of interviews from 784 interviewees along with transcripts and other 
  documentation.</p>

<p>Inspired by his experience making <i>Schindler’s List</i>, Steven Spielberg 
  established the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation in 1994 to 
  gather video testimonies from survivors and other witnesses of the Holocaust. 
  While most of those who gave testimony were Jewish survivors, the Foundation 
  also interviewed homosexual survivors, Jehovah’s Witness survivors, liberators 
  and liberation witnesses, political prisoners, rescuers and aid providers, Roma 
  and Sinti (Gypsy) survivors, survivors of eugenics policies, and war crimes 
  trials participants. Within several years, the Foundation’s Visual History Archive 
  held nearly 52,000 video testimonies in 32 languages, representing 56 countries; 
  it is the largest archive of its kind in the world. In 2006, the Foundation 
  became part of the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences 
  at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and was renamed as the 
  USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education. </p>
<p>The goal of the MALACH project was to develop methods for improved access to 
  large mulitnational spoken archives; the focus was advancing the state of the 
  art of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and information retrieval. The characteristics 
  of the USC-SFI collection -- unconstrained, natural speech filled with disfluencies, 
  heavy accents, age-related coarticulations, un-cued speaker and language switching 
  and emotional speech -- were considered well-suited for that task. The work 
  centered on five languages: English, Czech, Russian, Polish and Slovak. USC-SFI 
  MALACH Interviews and Transcripts English was developed for the English speech 
  recognition experiments. </p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The speech data in this release was collected beginning in 1994 under a wide 
  variety of conditions ranging from quiet to noisy (e.g., airplane overflights, 
  wind noise, background conversations and highway noise). Original interviews 
  were recorded on Sony Beta SP tapes, then digitized into a 3 MB/s MPEG-1 stream 
  with 128 kb/s (44 kHz) stereo audio. The sound files in this release are compressed 
  in MP3 format at a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz.</p>
<p>Approximately 25,000 of all USC-SFI collected interviews are in English and 
  average approximately 2.5 hours each. The 784 interviews included in this release 
  are each a 30 minute section of the corresponding larger interview. Due to the 
  way the original interviews were arranged on the tapes, some interviews are 
  clipped and have a duration of less than 30 minutes. Certain interviews include 
  speech from family members in addition to that of the subject and the interviewer. 
  Accordingly, the corpus contains speech from more than 784 speakers, who are 
  more or less equally distributed between males and females. The interviews also 
  include accented speech over a wide range (e.g., Hungarian, Italian, Yiddish, 
  German and Polish). </p>

<p>This release includes transcripts in trs format of the first 15 minutes of each 
  interview. The transcripts were created using <a href="http://trans.sourceforge.net/en/presentation.php">Transcriber</a> 
  1.5.1 and later modified; see <a href="./docs/transcription_fixed.txt">transcription_fixed.txt</a> 
  for further information on the changes made to the transcripts produced by Transcriber.</p>
