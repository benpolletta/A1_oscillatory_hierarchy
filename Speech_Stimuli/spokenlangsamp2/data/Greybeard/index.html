<h1>Greybeard</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2013S05</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Greybeard, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2013S05 and ISBN 
  1-58563-645-2, was developed by LDC and is comprised of approximately 590 hours 
  of English telephone conversation speech collected in October and November 2008 
  by LDC. The goal was to record new telephone conversations among subjects who 
  had participated in one or more previous LDC telephone collections, from Switchboard-1 
  (1991) through the Mixer studies (2006).</p>

<p>A total of 172 subjects were enrolled in the Greybeard collection, all of whom 
  had participated in one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Switchboard-1 
	(<a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC97S62">LDC97S62</a>)
	1991-1992:   2 subjects</li>
  <li>Switchboard-2 (<a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC98S75">LDC98S75</a>,
  <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC99S79">LDC99S79</a>,
  <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2002S06">LDC2002S06</a>) 
    1996-1997: 16 subjects</li>
  <li>Mixer 1 and 2  2003-2005: 103 subjects</li>
  <li>Mixer 3 2006: 51 subjects</li>
</ul>

<p>Most Greybeard participants completed 12 calls. Some subjects completed up 
  to 24 calls. Calls were made or received via an automatic operator system of LDC
  which connected two participants and announced a topic for discussion. </p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>This releases consists of 4680 calls -- the complete set of calls recorded 
  during the Greybeard collection (1098 calls) as well as all calls from the legacy 
  collections that involved the Greybeard speakers.</p>

<p>The audio from each call was captured digitally by the operator system and 
  stored in a separate file as raw mu-law sample data. As the recordings were 
  uploaded daily from the robot operator to network disk storage, automated processes 
  reformatted the audio into a 2-channel SPHERE-format file for each conversation 
  and queued the recordings for manual audit to verify speaker identification 
  and to check other aspects of the recording. Auditors provided impressionistic 
  judgments on overall audio quality, presence of background noise and cross-channel 
  echo and any other technical difficulty with the call, in addition to confirming 
  the speaker-ID on each channel. These auditor decisions are provided in the 
  "call_info" tables, described in more detailed in the included documentation.</p>

<p>For this release, each 2-channel recording was converted from SPHERE to MS-WAV 
  file format and compressed using FLAC. All audio files are 2-channel, 8 KHz, 
  16-bit PCM sample data, in FLAC-compressed form 
  (<a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net">http://flac.sourceforge.net</a>). 
  When uncompressed, they have MS-WAV/RIFF headers.</p>
