<h1>LDC Spoken Language Sampler - Second Release</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2013S06</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p> LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium) Spoken Language Sampler - Second Release,
LDC catalog number LDC2013S06 and ISBN 1-58563-653-3, contains samples from 20 
different corpora published by LDC between 1996 and 2013.</p>
<p>The Linguistic Data Consortium at the University of Pennsylvania distributes 
  a wide and growing assortment of resources for researchers, engineers and educators 
  whose work is concerned with human languages. Historically, most linguistic 
  resources were not generally available to interested researchers but were restricted 
  to single laboratories or to a limited number of users. Inspired by the success 
  of selected readily-available and well-known data sets, such as the Brown University 
  text corpus, LDC was founded in 1992 to provide a new mechanism for large-scale 
  corpus development and sharing of resources. With the support of its members, 
  LDC is able to provide critical services to the language research community. 
  These services include: maintaining the data archives, producing and distributing 
  data via media or web downloads, negotiating intellectual 
  property agreements with potential information providers and maintaining relations 
  with other like-minded groups around the world. </p>
<p>Resources available from LDC 
<a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu">(http://www.ldc.upenn.edu)</a> include speech, text,
 video data and lexicons in multiple languages, as well as software tools 
  to facilitate the use of corpus materials. For a complete view of LDC's publications, 
  a searchable catalog is available at <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/">http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/</a>. </p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The LDC Spoken Language Sampler - Second Release provides speech and transcript 
samples and is designed to illustrate the variety and breadth of the 
  resources available from the LDC Catalog. The sound files included in this release are
 excerpts that have been modified in various ways relative 
  to the original data as published by LDC: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Most excerpts are truncated to be much shorter than the original files, 
    typically between one and half and 2 minutes.</li>
  <li> Signal amplitude has been adjusted where necessary to normalize playback 
    volume.</li>
  <li> Some corpora are published in compressed form, but all samples here are 
    uncompressed.</li>
	
  <li>Some text files are presented as images to ensure foreign character sets 
    display properly.</li>
  <li> In some publications, LDC has used NIST SPHERE file format for audio data, 
    but the audio files in this sampler are MS-WAV/audio (RIFF) file format for 
    compatibility with typical browser audio utilities. FLAC files have been expanded 
    into their wav form as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>The link for the catalog number takes you to the catalog entry, and the link 
  for the title will take you to further documentation for that corpus.</p>
