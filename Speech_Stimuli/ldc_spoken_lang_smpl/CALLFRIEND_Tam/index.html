    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This directory contains sample data from CALLFRIEND Tamil, Linguistic Data 
  Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC96S59 and isbn 1-58563-074-8. 
<p>Tamil is a Dravidian language spoken in the Tamil Nadu state of Southern India 
  where it is an official language, and in Sri Lanka where it is spoken by the 
  Tamil ethnic minority. The language also has speakers in Singapore, Malaysia 
  and South Africa. In all, some 66 million people use Tamil as their first language. 
  It is a diglossic language with a literary version that is distinct from the 
  everyday spoken dialect. While the written form of Tamil is fairly standard 
  throughout its diaspora, there is no recognized spoken standard. However, such 
  a standard form may be coalescing out of the upper cast Tamil dialects in Tamil 
  Nadu. 
<h3>Data</h3>

    
<p>CALLFRIEND Tamil consists of 60 unscripted telephone conversations between 
  native Tamil speakers lasting between 5-30 minutes each. The corpus also includes 
  documentation describing speaker information (sex, age, education, callee telephone 
  number) and call information (channel quality, number of speakers). 
<p>For each conversation, both the caller and callee were native speakers of Tamil; 
  all calls were placed inside the continental United States and Canada. </p>
<p>Presented here are three two-minute samples from selected phone calls. The 
  sample audio files are MS Wave files (.wav), but the actual corpus uses the 
  NIST Sphere audio file format. <a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tools/sphere_26atarZ.htm">Software</a> 
  to convert NIST to other formats is readily available through LDC. The demographic 
  information listed below describes the persons placing the call in the sample 
  files. </p>
