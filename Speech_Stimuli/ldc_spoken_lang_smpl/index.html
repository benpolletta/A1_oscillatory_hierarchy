    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains documentation for the LDC Spoken Language Sampler, Linguistic 
  Data Consortium catalog number LDC2008S08 and ISBN 1-585630-495-6. 
<p>The Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) at the University of Pennsylvania distributes 
  a wide and growing assortment of resources for researchers, engineers and educators 
  whose work is concerned with human languages. Historically, most linguistic 
  resources were not generally available to interested researchers but were restricted 
  to single laboratories or to a limited number of users. Inspired by the success 
  of selected readily available and well-known data sets, such as the Brown University 
  text corpus, LDC was founded in 1992 to provide a new mechanism for large-scale 
  corpus development and sharing of resources. In 2008, LDC is a growing consortium 
  that includes more than 100 companies, universities, and government members 
  that has distributed over 50,000 corpora to a global audience. With the support 
  of its members, LDC is able to provide critical services to the language research 
  community. These services include: maintaining the data archives, producing 
  and distributing data via media (DVD-ROM or CD-ROM) or web downloads, negotiating 
  intellectual property agreements with potential information providers and would-be 
  members, and maintaining relations with other like-minded groups around the 
  world. 
<p>Resources available from LDC (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu) include speech, text 
  and video data and lexicons in multiple languages, as well as software tools 
  to facilitate the use of corpus materials. For a complete view of LDC's publications, 
  a searchable catalog is available at <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/">http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/</a>. 
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The LDC Spoken Language Sampler provides a variety of speech, transcript and 
  lexicon samples and is designed to illustrate the variety and breadth of the 
  resources available from LDC&#8217;s Catalog. If you are reading this &quot;index.html&quot; 
  file with a web browser, you should be able to click on the links in the table 
  below to listen to audio files and to view their descriptions and any transcripts 
  or other metadata. Please note that the &quot;Sound file&quot; links in the 
  tables actually point to excerpts that have been modified in various ways relative 
  to the original data as published by LDC: </p>
<ul>
  <li> most excerpts are truncated to be much shorter than the original files, 
    typically one minute and thirty seconds of speech; </li>
  <li> signal amplitude has been adjusted where necessary to normalize playback 
    volume;</li>
  <li> some corpora are published in compressed form, but all samples here are 
    uncompressed;</li>
  <li> LDC typically uses NIST SPHERE file format for audio data, but the audio 
    files in this sampler have been converted to MS-WAV/audio (RIFF) file format 
    for compatibility with typical browser audio utilities.</li>
</ul>
