  and Transcript Sampler</font></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>Korean Telephone Conversations Speech and Transcripts were produced by Linguistic 
  Data Consortium (LDC). The corpora are indexed under LDC catalog numbers LDC2003S03 
  (speech) and LDC2003T08 (transcripts), ISBNs 1-58563-264-3 and 1-58563-263-5, 
  respectively. 
<p>The telephone conversations were collected by LDC as part of the CALLFRIEND 
  project in support of the Language Identification (LID) project sponsored by 
  the U.S. Department of Defense. The telephone speech was later transcribed for 
  use in other projects. 
<p>The recorded conversations are between native speakers of Korean and last up 
  to 30 minutes. The transcriptions cover 15-18 minutes from each conversation. 
  All speakers were aware that they were being recorded. They were given no guidelines 
  concerning conversation topics.. Once a caller was recruited to participate, 
  he/she was given a free choice of whom to call. Most participants called family 
  members or close friends. All calls originated in either the United States or 
  Canada. 
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Presented below are three two-minute audio samples and their associated transcripts. 
  The samples are in MS Wave (.wav) format. The data in the full corpus is in 
  NIST Sphere audio format. The transcripts use EUC-KR character encoding. To 
  ensure compatibility, the transcripts are also presented as PDF files as well 
  as raw text.</p>
