    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This directory contains sample data from CALLFRIEND Farsi, Linguistic Data 
  Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC96S50 and isbn 1-58563-065-9. 
<p> CALLFRIEND Farsi was collected by LDC primarily in support of the Language 
  Identification (LID) project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. This 
  corpus consists of 60 unscripted telephone conversations between native speakers 
  of Farsi. The recorded conversations last up to 30 minutes, and participants 
  were not restricted in the choice of their conversation topics. All speakers 
  were aware that their conversations were recored for research. Once a caller 
  was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free choice of whom to call. 
  Most participants called family members or close friends. All calls originated 
  in either the United States or Canada.
<p>Farsi, also known as Persian, is the principal language of Iran and has a large 
  diaspora of speakers throughout the world. There are roughly 23 million Farsi 
  speakers worldwide. Farsi is an Indo-European language and a member of the West 
  Iranian family of languages; it is closely related to Dari and Tajik. The current 
  distribution of Farsi centers around Iran and extends to the neighboring Persian 
  Gulf states. Historically, the range of the language was quite large and inlcuded 
  portions of India and Mesopatamia. For that reason, Farsi influenced the development 
  of the Turkic and Hindustani languages. </p>
<h3>Data</h3>

    
<p> Speakers were solicited by the LDC to participate in this telephone speech 
  collection effort via the internet, publications (advertisements), and personal 
  contacts. A total of 100 call originators were found, each of whom placed a 
  telephone call via a toll-free robot operator maintained by the LDC. Access 
  to the robot operator was possible via a unique Personal Identification Number 
  (PIN) issued by the recruiting staff at the LDC when the caller enrolled in 
  the project. The participants were made aware that their telephone call would 
  be recorded, as were the call recipients. The call was allowed only if both 
  parties agreed to being recorded. Each caller was allowed to talk up to 30 minutes. 
  Upon successful completion of the call, the caller was paid $20 (in addition 
  to making a free long-distance telephone call). Each caller was allowed to place 
  only one telephone call. After a successful call was completed, a human audit 
  of each telephone call was conducted to verify that the proper language was 
  spoken and to check the quality of the recording. 
<p>Presented here are three two-minute samples from selected phone calls. The 
  sample audio files are MS Wave files (.wav), but the actual corpus uses the 
  NIST Sphere audio file format. <a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tools/sphere_26atarZ.htm">Software</a> 
  to convert NIST to other formats is readily available through the LDC. The demographic 
  information listed below describes the person placing the call in the samples.
