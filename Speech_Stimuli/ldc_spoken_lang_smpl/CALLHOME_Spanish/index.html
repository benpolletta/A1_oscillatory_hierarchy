    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains information about, and samples from, the CALLHOME Spanish 
  collection, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog numbers LDC96S35 (speech) 
  and LDC96T17 (transcripts) and isbns 1-58563-083-7 and 1-58563-084-5, respectively. 
<p>CALLHOME Spanish was collected and transcribed by LDC primarily in support 
  of the Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition (LVCSR) project sponsored 
  by the U.S. Department of Defense. It consists of 120 unscripted telephone conversations 
  between native Spanish speakers. The transcripts cover a contiguous 5 or 10 
  minute segment (see section 2 below) taken from a recorded conversation lasting 
  up to 30 minutes.
<p>Speakers were solicited by Rutgers University and LDC through personal contacts 
  and via the internet. A total of 200 call originators were enrolled, each of 
  whom placed a telephone call via a toll-free robot operator maintained originally 
  by Rutgers University and later by LDC. Access to the robot operator was controlled 
  by a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) issued by the recruiting staff 
  at Rutgers or LDC when the caller enrolled in the project. Each caller placed 
  one telephone call and spoke up to 30 minutes. </p>
<p>All speakers were aware that they were being recorded. They were given no guidelines 
  concerning conversation topics. Once a caller was recruited to participate in 
  the collectoin, he/she was given a free choice of whom to call. Most participants 
  called family members or close friends overseas. All calls originated in North 
  America. The transcripts are timestamped by speaker turn for alignment with 
  the speech signal and are provided in standard orthography.</p>
<p>In all, 200 calls were transcribed. Of these, 80 have been designated as training 
  calls, 20 as development test calls, and 100 as evaluation test calls. For each 
  of the training and development test calls, a contiguous 10-minute region was 
  selected for transcription; for the evaluation test calls, a 5-minute region 
  was transcribed. The data released by LDC (LDC97T17) contains only 20 of the 
  evaluation test calls; the remaining 80 test calls are being held in reserve 
  for future LVCSR benchmark tests.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>

    
<p>Presented here are three two-minute call samples and their associated transcripts. 
  The audio files in the LDC corpus are in NIST Sphere format. The sample audio 
  files are are in MS Wav format (.wav). Transcripts use the Western European 
  ISO-8859-1 character encoding scheme. Transcriptions appear in both PDF and 
  raw text to ensure compatibility.
