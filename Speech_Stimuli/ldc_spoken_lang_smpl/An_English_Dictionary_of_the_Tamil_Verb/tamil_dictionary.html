    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains documentation and samples for <strong>An English Dictionary 
  of the Tamil Verb</strong>, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number 
  LDC2008L01 and isbn 1-58563-464-6. </p>

<p><strong>An English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb</strong> represents over twenty-five 
  years of work led by Harold F. Schiffman, Professor, emeritus, of Dravidian 
  Lingusitics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania's Department of South 
  Asia Studies. It contains translations for 6597 English verbs and defines 9716 
  Tamil verbs. This release presents the dictionary in two formats: Adobe PDF 
  and XML. The PDF format displays the dictionary in a human readable form and 
  is suitable for printing. The XML version is a purely electronic form which, 
  while readable by humans, is intended mainly for application development and 
  the creation of searchable electronic databases. In the electronic XML version 
  each entry contains the following: the English entry or head word; the Tamil 
  equivalent (in Tamil script and transliteration); the verb class and transitivity 
  specification; the spoken Tamil pronunciation (audio files in mp3 format); the 
  English definition(s); additional Tamil entries (if applicable); example sentences 
  or phrases in Literary Tamil, Spoken Tamil (with a corresponding audio file 
  in .mp3 format) and an English translation; and Tamil synonyms or near-synonyms, 
  where appropriate. Some foods referenced in the example sentences are illustrated 
  in html files that include detailed description of each dish. It is expected 
  that the dictionary will be useful for Tamil learners, scholars and others interested 
  in the Tamil language. 
<h3>The Tamil Verb</h3> 
<p>Tamil is an official language of India, Singapore and Sri Lanka and has roughly 66 million native speakers worldwide.  Most Tamil speakers live in the Tamil Nadu State of India and northeastern Sri Lanka, but the extended diaspora includes Malaysia, Mauritius and Singapore. Tamil is also a Classical Language of India. A member of the Dravidian language family, it boasts a rich literary tradition stretching back over 2200 years.</p>

<p>Tamil is a diglossic language, meaning that it consists of at least two distinct 
  forms. Spoken Tamil (ST) refers to the numerous vernacular dialects, and Literary 
  Tamil (LT) refers to the form of the language used in print and most broadcast 
  news media. The dialects of Spoken Tamil fall along regional divisions and along 
  caste lines; there is no widely adopted standard for ST, although one seems 
  to be emerging. Educated Tamil speakers, on the other hand, generally use LT 
  with little variation in written communication. It appears, however, that a 
  common dialect of ST may be emerging as a result of a growing broadcast media 
  and increased rates of higher education. That dialect resembles the upper caste 
  (non-Brahman) dialects spoken in the urban centers of Tamil Nadu and borrows 
  verbs from LT. The spoken examples in An English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb 
  reflect this emerging common dialect.</p>

<p>Tamil is also an agglutinative language, meaning that it constructs verbs by 
  appending inflections in the form of suffixes onto basic verb-stem morphemes. 
  These inflections primarily denote tense, aspect, voice and mood. As far as 
  voice is concerned, however, though LT may mark a verb as passive on occasion, 
  ST rarely makes this distinction. These suffixes mark whether a verb is transitive 
  or intransitive, that is, they indicate whether the subject is acted on by the 
  verb or whether the subject is the actor. Mood is implied by verb tense, but 
  may also be provided by verbal auxiliaries expressing various degrees of probability, 
  futurity, ability, and their negatives. Tamil also may add suffixes that mark 
  aspectual distinctions, such as whether an action is considered to be perfective 
  ('complete' and/or 'definite') or whether it is ongoing or imperfective ('continuous' 
  or 'durative'), as well as other distinctions. Aspect is a category that is 
  undergoing increasing grammaticalization and is therefore more usual in ST than 
  in LT. As is common with this process, aspectual distinctions are 'speaker-centered', 
  i.e. they provide personal observations (some analysts have referred to this 
  as 'attitude' or 'point of view', which is of course what the word 'aspect' 
  originally means) which describe the speaker's frame of mind concerning the 
  event depicted in the sentence -- whether it is perceived to be beneficial or 
  detrimental, positive or negative, voluntary or involuntary, etc. Aspectual 
  distinctions vary widely among dialects, both because of the variability of 
  the grammaticalization process and for historical reasons, and Tamil speakers 
  can code-switch among different dialects depending on context and audience. 
  In addition, ST and LT treat the grammar of verbs differently. Finding exact 
  equivalents between English and Tamil verbs is very difficult as a result of 
  Tamil's diglossic nature and because of the difficulty of mapping English aspectual 
  distinctions onto Tamil aspectual categories.</p> 


<p>An English Dictionary of the Tamil Verb seeks to meet needs not currently addressed 
  by existing English-Tamil dictionaries. The main goal of this dictionary is 
  to get an English-knowing user to a Tamil verb, irrespective of whether he or 
  she begins with an English verb or some other item, such as an adjective; this 
  is because what may be a verb in Tamil may in fact not be a verb in English, 
  and vice versa. Since the number of English entries is limited (slightly less 
  than 10,000) there may not be main entries for certain low-frequency items like 
  'pounce' but this item does appear as a synonym for 'jump, leap', and some other 
  verbs, so searching for 'pounce' will get the user to a Tamil verb via the synonym 
  field. The main goal is therefore to specifically concentrate on supplying the 
  kinds of information lacking in all previous attempts to capture the equivalencies 
  between English and Tamil. This dictionary addresses the following problem areas:</p>

<ul>
   <li>	<strong>Verb classes</strong>: English-Tamil dictionaries, both current and previously extant, do not provide the user with any information about the morphological class of the Tamil verb, nor do they give information as to whether a verb is transitive or intransitive. This kind of information is readily available in Tamil-English dictionaries, but not in English-Tamil dictionaries.</li> 

   <li>	<strong>Spoken Tamil</strong>: No English-Tamil dictionary gives information about the spoken or colloquial pronunciation of Tamil.  Nor do they indicate whether a verb found in Literary Tamil is also used in Spoken Tamil. Information about ST is harder to get than Tamil in any other form. No electronic databases exist for ST, and many speakers of Tamil do not consider ST to be worth devoting any attention to. For non-Tamil speakers attempting to learn Tamil, however, ST is necessary for day-to-day functioning in a Tamil environment, and this dictionary is intended to meet their needs, not primarily the needs of native speakers. </li>

   <li>	<strong>Example Sentences</strong>:  Currently extant English-Tamil dictionaries give few if any example sentences that illustrate the morphological and/or syntactic frames in which verbs occur. This is particularly important for ST, since it is morphologically and syntactically more complex than LT, especially in the verb phrase.</li>
 
   
  <li><strong>Modern Usage</strong>: Most extant English-Tamil dictionaries are 
    now seriously out of date. Their compilers have often simply replicated the 
    data found in previous dictionaries, with the result that the English represented 
    in them is that of previous centuries. The Tamil forms given are also lacking 
    in modernity, but for other reasons. </li>
 
   
  <li> <strong>Syntactic Complexity of the Verb Phrase</strong>: Because the Tamil 
    verb is morphologically complex, and the verb phrase therefore syntactically 
    very complex, the authors decided to focus only on the Tamil verb. Tamil nouns 
    are, in contrast, morphologically simple, and the noun phrase is remarkably 
    uncomplicated. Tamil nouns have no gender distinctions (except where there 
    is biological gender), no agreement, and adjectives are not inflected for 
    number or gender. The Tamil Nadu government has spent much time and energy 
    creating lexica and glossaries for various modern usages for Tamil, but these 
    have mainly generated new nominal terminology, not verbs. This is partly because 
    LT cannot borrow verbs easily, i.e. it cannot take a 'foreign' word and add 
    Tamil morphological material to it, such as tense marking and person-number-gender 
    marking, which all Tamil finite verbs must have. ST, on the other hand, has 
    no problem with borrowings or other innovative word-formation devices. Spoken 
    Tamil, however is not deemed worthy of being used in such contexts.</li> 
 
  <li>	<strong>Sound Files</strong>: Finally, this dictionary, because of its electronic format, contains sound recordings of every Spoken Tamil example sentence, which of course could not be a part of any previous dictionaries printed on paper. Since most readers of LT already possess a familiarity with some form of ST, sound files for verbs in this form are not provided.  The spoken verbs in this dictionary are drawn from the emerging common dialect of Tamil.</li>
</ul>




    

    
<h3>Samples</h3>


    
<p>The dictionary is published in two formats, PDF and XML. The PDF version is 
  a human readable dictionary that includes a discussion of the methodologly used 
  in collecting the verbs. The XML version is an electronic format useful for 
  advanced searching and building software applications. Linked into each XML 
  entry is an audio file for the verb presenting the example sentence as spoken 
  by a native Tamil speaker. The jpeg screen captures below show several entries 
  from the dictionary. Each is linked with the example audio file which may be 
  played simply by clicking on the image. These images were taken from an HTML 
  transformation of the dictionary. For completeness, these samples are also presented 
  as an <a href="tamil_sample_dictionary.html">HTML file.</a> In order to view 
  this file properly, extended language support must be turned on and the browser 
  language set to Tamil.</p>
