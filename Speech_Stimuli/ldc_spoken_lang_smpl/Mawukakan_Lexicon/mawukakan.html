    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains information about, and sample data from, the Mawukakan Lexicon, 
  Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2005L01 and isbn 1-58563-337-2. 
<p>The Mawukakan Lexicon is the first publication of an on going project aiming 
  to build an electronic dictionary of four Mandekan [Eastern Manding languages 
  of the Mande Group of the Niger-Congo family] languages at the LDC. The other 
  three variants of Mandekan involved are the Bambara or Bamanankan [Mali], the 
  Maninka or Maninkakan [Guinea-Conakry] and the Odienne Jula or Wojenekakan [Cote 
  d'Ivoire]. The lack of written tradition makes such a dictionary project extremely 
  important. </p>

<p> For the dictionary of a small language like Mawukakan (less than half of a 
  million speakers) to be the most useful, it has to combine the linguistic component 
  with a cultural component. The fact that the Mawukakan - English lexicon is 
  coupled with a Mawukakan - French lexicon makes this project a bit more important, 
  given that Mawukakan speakers live mostly in the francophone area of West Africa. 
  This project collected the largest possible amount of data on the Mandekan and 
  the Manding culture and has been made available at LDC for the research community.</p>
<p>The concept of dictionary making at LDC is a revolutionary approach to studying 
  the lexicology of languages that do not have a writing tradition. The project 
  is very original in that it extends the scope of the lexical database beyond 
  a simple list of lexical entries. It suggests that the database includes, in 
  addition to the lexicon itself, anything that can promote a better knowledge 
  of the language and the culture of the Manding people. This includes a collection 
  of audio and video recordings as well as all the written materials available 
  on the language and the culture. By adopting this concept, it becomes easy to 
  preserve small languages like Mawukakan from a speedy death. Apart from creating 
  the best conditions for the popularization and standardization of the writing 
  system of concerned languages, this new approach to lexicology can significantly 
  minimize the research cost on these languages and cultures. Creating the largest 
  electronic database on Mandekan and the Manding culture is more than suitable 
  since the availability of such a database can contribute to increased exposure 
  of all the aspects of both the language and its culture. Because of its electronic 
  nature, updating the database will be an easy and permanent exercise, dependent 
  on the feedback received. This will also reduce the number of fieldtrips Mandekan 
  researchers need to take.</p>
<p> Today's technological breakthroughs makes such objectives not very difficult 
  to reach. The powerful computers and modern dictionary-making tools available 
  have transformed lexicology into a more exciting enterprise than before. Our 
  wish is however that the final product be exploitable by linguists as well as 
  all other researchers who are interested in the language and the culture of 
  the Mandenkas. This explains in part our choice of the <a href="http://www.esl-lounge.com/pronunciation/phonetic-chart.shtml">International 
  Phonetic Alphabet [IPA]</a> as the main transcription system of Mawukakan. IPA 
  is the least costly system for transcribing the African languages without a 
  writing tradition and whose alphabet was defined only at the end of the 1950s, 
  a period in which most of the colonies in West Africa became independent.<br>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The Mawukakan Lexicon is delivered in two formats. The first is a <a href="http://www.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?id=79">Linguist's 
  Toolbox</a> project and data file pair. The second is an XML file encoded in 
  UTF-8. Presented below are several entries (as JPEG image files) of an HTML 
  transformation that presents the data in a human readable manner.</p>
