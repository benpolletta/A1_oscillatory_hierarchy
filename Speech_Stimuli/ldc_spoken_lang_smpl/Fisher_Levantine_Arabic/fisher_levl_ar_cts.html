    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains samples and information for Fisher Levantine Arabic Conversational 
  Telephone Speech and Transcripts, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog numbers 
  LDC2007S02 (speech) and LDC2007T04 (transcripts), isbns 1-58563-439-5 and 1-58563-411-5, 
  respectively. 
<p>Levantine Arabic is spoken along the western Mediterranean coast from Anatolia 
  to the Sinai Pennsiula and encompasses the local dialects of Lebanon, Syria 
  and Palestine. There are two distinct varieties: Northern, centered around Syria 
  and Lebanon; and Southern, spoken in Jordan and Palestine. Northern Levantine 
  Arabic speakers include approximately 8.8 million speakers in Syria and 6 million 
  speakers in Lebanon. Southern Levantine Arabic speakers include approximately 
  3.5 million speakers in Jordan, 1.6 million speakers in Palestine, and nearly 
  one million speakers in Israel. All varieties of Levantine Arabic retain the 
  language's original stress pattern and stand out when compared to other regional 
  dialects. In addition, Levantine Arabic contains traces of Aramaic. 
<p>Fisher Levantine Arabic Conversational Telephone Speech is distributed by LDC 
  in two parts, as a speech corpus and as a seperate transcript collection, for 
  279 telephone conversations (approximately 45 hours of speech). The majority 
  of the speakers are from Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine. 
<p>The transcripts were created with &quot;green&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot; 
  layers using LDC's Arabic Multi-Dialectal Transcription Tool (AMADAT). The green 
  layer seeks to anchor dialectal forms to similar or related Modern Standard 
  Arabic orthography-based forms. The yellow layer is a more careful and detailed 
  transcription that adds functionally necessary vowels and marks important sociolinguistic 
  variations and morphophonemic features.
<p>For a complete description of the transcription and annotation methodology, 
  please refer to the following papers:

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Presented below are three two-minute audio files and their transcriptions along 
  with demographic information about the speakers. (Each conversation in the full 
  corpus is approximately ten minutes in length.) The transcripts are encoded 
  using Unicode UTF-8 character encoding. The transcript samples are also presented 
  as PDF files to ensure compatibility.</p>
