<h1>LDC Spoken Language Sampler - Fourth Release</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2017S16</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

    
<p> LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium) Spoken Language Sampler - Fourth Release,
LDC catalog number LDC2017S16 and ISBN 1-58563-811-0, contains samples from 18 
different corpora published by LDC between 1996 and 2017.</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/">LDC</a> distributes 
  a wide and growing assortment of resources for researchers, engineers and educators 
  whose work is concerned with human languages. Historically, most linguistic 
  resources were not generally available to interested researchers but were restricted 
  to single laboratories or to a limited number of users. Inspired by the success 
  of selected readily-available and well-known data sets, such as the Brown University 
  text corpus, LDC was founded in 1992 to provide a new mechanism for large-scale 
  corpus development and resource sharing. With the support of its members, 
  LDC  provides critical services to the language research community that include: maintaining the LDC data archives, producing and distributing 
  data via media or web download, negotiating intellectual 
  property agreements with potential information providers and maintaining relations 
  with other like-minded groups around the world. </p>
<p>Resources available from LDC include speech, text,
 video data and lexicons in multiple languages, as well as software tools 
  to facilitate the use of corpus materials. For a complete view of LDC's publications, 
  browse the <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/">Catalog</a>. </p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The LDC Spoken Language Sampler - Fourth Release provides speech and transcript 
samples and is designed to illustrate the variety and breadth of the 
  speech-related resources available from the LDC Catalog. The sound files included in this release are
 excerpts that have been modified in various ways relative 
  to the original data as published by LDC: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Most excerpts are truncated to be much shorter than the original files, 
    typically between 1.5 and 2 minutes.</li>
  <li> Signal amplitude has been adjusted where necessary to normalize playback 
    volume.</li>
  <li> Some corpora are published in compressed form, but all samples here are 
    uncompressed.</li>
	
  <li>Some text files are presented as images to ensure foreign character sets 
    display properly.</li>
  <li> In some publications, NIST SPHERE file format is used for audio data, 
    but the audio files in this sampler are MS-WAV/audio (RIFF) file format for 
    compatibility with typical browser audio utilities. FLAC files have been expanded 
    into their wav form as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>The link for the catalog number takes you to the catalog entry, and the link 
  for the title  takes you to further documentation for that corpus.</p>
