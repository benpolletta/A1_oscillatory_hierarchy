    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>2010 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Test Set, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) catalog number LDC2017S06 and ISBN 1-58563-795-5, was developed by LDC 
  and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). It contains 2,255 hours 
  of American English telephone speech and speech
recorded over a microphone channel involving an interview scenario used as test 
  data in the NIST-sponsored <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/spk/2010/index.html"> 
  2010 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE)</a>. </p>
  <p>The ongoing series of SRE yearly evaluations conducted by NIST are intended to be of 
  interest to researchers working on the general problem of text independent speaker 
  recognition. To this end the evaluations are designed to be simple, to focus on 
  core technology issues, to be fully supported and to be accessible to those wishing 
  to participate.</p>
<p>The 2010 evaluation was similar to the  2008 evaluation by including in the training and test
conditions for the core test not only conversational
telephone speech (CTS) recorded over ordinary
telephone channels, but also CTS and conversational interview speech  recorded over a room
microphone channel. Unlike prior evaluations, some of the conversational telephone style speech was collected in a
manner to produce particularly high, or particularly low, vocal
effort on the part of the speaker of interest.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>	
<p>The speech recordings in this release were collected in 2009 and 2010 by
LDC at its <a href="https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/about/facilities/human-subjects-collection">Human Subjects  Collection</a> facility in
Philadelphia. This collection was part of the Mixer 6 project, which was
designed to support the development of robust speaker recognition
technology by providing carefully collected and audited speech from a large
pool of speakers recorded simultaneously across numerous microphones.</p>

<p>The telephone speech segments include two-channel excerpts of approximately
10 seconds and 5 minutes.  There are also summed-channel excerpts in the
range of 5 minutes.  The microphone excerpts are 3-15 minutes in
duration. As in prior evaluations, intervals of silence were not removed.
The data included in this release is 8 bit ulaw with a sample rate of 8000.</p>
<p>In addition to evaluation data, this package also consists of answer keys,
trial and train files, development data and evaluation documentation.</p>
