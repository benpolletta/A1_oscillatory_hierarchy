<h1>Noisy TIMIT Speech</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Noisy TIMIT Speech, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2017S04 and ISBN 1-58563-793-9, was developed by the <a href="http://www.fit.edu/">Florida Institute of Technology</a> and contains approximately
322 hours of  
speech from the TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus
 (<a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1">LDC93S1</a>) modified with 
 different additive noise levels. Only the audio has been modified;  the original arrangement of the TIMIT corpus is still as 
described by the TIMIT documentation. </p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The additive noise are white, pink, blue, red, violet
 and babble noise with noise levels varying in 5 dB (decibel) steps and ranges 
from 5 to 50 dB. </p>
<p>The color of noise refers to the power spectrum of a noise  signal. Sound waves have two characteristics: frequency, which describes how  fast the waveform vibrates per second; and amplitude, the size of the waveform.  Colored noises are named in an analogy to the colors of light.Â  For instance, white noise contains all  audible frequencies just as white light contains all frequencies in the visible  range. Non-white colored noises have more energy concentrated at the high or  low end of the sound spectrum.<a href="https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm"></a> White, pink and blue noise are officially defined in the <a href="https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm">federal telecommunications  standard</a>.</p>
<p>The white, pink, blue, red and violet noise types added to  the TIMIT data in this release were generated artificially using MATLAB. For  the babble noise, a random segment of recorded babble speech was selected and  scaled relative to the power of the original TIMIT audio signal.</p>
<p>All audio files
  are presented as single channel 16kHz 16-flac.</p>

    <h3>Related Works incorporating TIMIT</h3>
    <p>TIMIT was designed to provide speech data for acoustic-phonetic studies and for the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems. Since its release in 1993, several corpora have been developed using the TIMIT database:</p>
    <p>NTIMIT (<a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S2">LDC93S2</a>): transmitting TIMIT recordings through a telephone handset and over various channels in the NYNEX telephone network</p>
