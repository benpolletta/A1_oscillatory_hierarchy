<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Walking Around Corpus, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2015S08 and ISBN 1-58563-722-X, was developed by 
  <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a> and 
  is comprised of approximately 33 hours of navigational  telephone dialogues from 72 speakers (36 speaker pairs).
  Participants were Stony Brook University students who identified themselves as native English speakers. </p>
<p>This corpus was elicited using a navigation task in which one person directed another to walk to 18 unique destinations on Stony Brook Universityâ€™s West campus. The direction-giver remained inside the lab and gave directions on a landline telephone to the pedestrian who used a mobile phone. As they visited each location, the pedestrians took a picture of each of the 18 destinations using the mobile phone. Pairs conversed spontaneously as they completed the task. The pedestrians' locations were tracked using their cell phones' GPS systems. The pedestrians did not have any maps or pictures of the target destinations and therefore relied on the direction-giver's verbal directions and descriptions to locate and photograph the target destinations.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The conversations were recorded by means of a Public Switched Telephone
Network (PSTN) conferencing service. Due to the nature of the task, the recordings contain
occasional background noise. </p>
<p>Each digital audio file was transcribed with time stamps. Most of the
  recordings were first transcribed by a transcription company and then
  edited and checked by a trained graduate student. All other transcripts
  were transcribed by trained students at Stony Brook University. The corpus
  material also includes the visual materials (pictures and maps) used to
  elicit the dialogues, data about the speakers' relationship, spatial abilities and 
  memory performance, and other information. </p>
<p>All audio is presented as 8000Hz, 16-bit flac compressed wav. Note the data was converted from wav, so some documentation may still indicate wav. Transcripts are presented as xls spreadsheets. </p>
