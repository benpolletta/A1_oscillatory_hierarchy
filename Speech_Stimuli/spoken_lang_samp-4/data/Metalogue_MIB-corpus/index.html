<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Metalogue Multi-Issue Bargaining Dialogue, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2017S11 and ISBN 1-58563-805-6, was developed by the <a href = "http://www.metalogue.eu/consortium/">Metalogue Consortium</a> under the European Community's <a href = "https://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm">Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development</a>. This release consists of approximately 2.5 hours of semantically annotated English dialogue data that includes speech and transcripts. </p>
<p>The goal of the Metalogue project was to develop a dialogue system with flexible dialogue management to enable the system's behavior in setting goals, choosing strategies and monitoring various processes. Participants were involved in a
  multi-issue bargaining scenario in which a representative of a city council
and a representative of small business owners negotiated the implementation of new anti-smoking regulations. The negotiation involved four issues, each with four or five options. Participants received a preference profile for each scenario and negotiated for an agreement with the highest value based on their preference information. Negotiators were not allowed to accept an agreement with a negative value or to share their preference profiles with other participants.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Six unique subjects (undergraduates between 19 and 25 years of age) participated in the collection. The dialogue speech was captured with two headset
microphones and saved in 16kHz, 16-bit mono linear PCM FLAC format. Speech signal files are
of two types: full dialogue session; and segmented speech signal, cut
per speaker and roughly per turn. </p>
<p>Transcripts were produced semi-automatically, using an automatic speech recognizer followed by manual correction.  </p>
<p>Seven types of annotation were performed manually using the <a href="http://www.anvil-software.org/">Anvil</a> tool: dialogue act annotations; discourse structure acts; contact management acts; task management dialogue acts; negotiation moves; rhetorical relations; and disfluencies in speech production. More information about the annotation process is included in the documentation. </p>
<p>All text is presented in UTF-8 as either plain text or XML.</p>
