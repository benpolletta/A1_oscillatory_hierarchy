<h1>Mandarin-English Code-Switching in South-East Asia</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2015S04</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Mandarin-English Code-Switching in South-East Asia, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2015S04 and ISBN 1-58563-709-2, was developed by 
  <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx">Nanyang Technological University</a>
   and 
  <a href="http://www.usm.my/index.php/en/">Universiti Sains Malaysia</a> 
  in Singapore
  and Malaysia, respectively. It is comprised of approximately 192 hours of 
  Mandarin-English code-switching speech from 156 speakers with associated transcripts.</p>
<p>Code-switching refers to the practice of shifting between languages or language varieties during conversation. This corpus focuses on the shift between Mandarin and English by Malaysian and Singaporean speakers.  Speakers engaged in unscripted conversations and interviews. In the conversational speech segments, two speakers conversed freely with each other. The interviews consisted of questions from an interviewer and answers from an interviewee; only the interviewee's speech was recorded. Topics discussed
range from hobbies, friends, and daily activities. </p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The speakers were gender-balanced (49.7% female, 50.3% male) and between   19 and 33 years of age. Over 60%  of the speakers were  Singaporean; the rest were Malaysian.</p>
<p>The speech recordings were conducted in a quiet room using several microphones and recording devices. Details about the recording conditions are contained in the documentation provided with this release. The audio files in this corpus are 16KHz, 16-bit  recordings in flac compressed 
  wav format  between
  20 and 120 minutes in length.</p>
<p> Selected segments of the audio recordings were  transcribed. Most of those segments contain  code-switching utterances. The 
  transcription file for each audio file is stored in UTF-8 tab-separated 
  text file format.</p>
