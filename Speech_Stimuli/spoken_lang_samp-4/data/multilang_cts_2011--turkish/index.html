<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Multi-Language Conversational Telephone Speech 2011 -- Turkish, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2017S09  and ISBN 1-58563-799-8, was developed by LDC 
and is comprised of approximately 18 hours of telephone speech in Turkish. </p>
<p>The data were collected primarily to support research and technology
  evaluation in automatic language identification, and portions of these
  telephone calls were used in the NIST 2011 Language Recognition Evaluation (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/2011-language-recognition-evaluation">LRE</a>). LRE 2011 focused on language pair discrimination for 24 languages/dialects, some of which could be considered mutually intelligible or closely related.</p>
  <p>LDC has also released the following as part of the Multi-Language Conversation Telephone Speech 2011 series:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Slavic Group (<a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2016S11">LDC2016S11</a>)</li>
  </ul>
     
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Participants were recruited by  native speakers who contacted acquaintances in their social network. Those native speakers made one call, up to 15 minutes, to each acquaintance.    The data was collected using <a href="https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/about/facilities/human-subjects-collection">LDC's telephone collection infrastructure</a>, comprised of three computer telephony systems. Human auditors labeled calls for callee gender, dialect type and noise. Demographic information about the participants was not collected.</p>
<p>All audio data are presented in FLAC-compressed MS-WAV (RIFF)
  file format (*.flac); when uncompressed, each file is 2 channels, recorded at
  8000 samples/second with samples stored as 16-bit signed integers,
  representing a lossless conversion from the original mu-law sample
  data as captured digitally from the public telephone network. The following table summarizes the total number of calls, total number
  of hours of recorded audio, and the total size of compressed data:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>group</td><td>lng</td><td>#calls</td><td>#hours</td><td>#MB</td></tr>
<tr><td>turkish</td>	<td>tur</td>	<td>87</td>	<td>18.6</td>	<td>975</td></tr>
</table>
