<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Articulation Index LSCP, Linguistic Data Consortium 
(LDC) Catalog Number LDC2015S12 and ISBN 1-58563-735-1, was developed by researchers at <a href="http://www.lscp.net/index.php?lang=en">Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique (LSCP), Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure</a>. It revises and enhances a subset of Articulation Index (AIC)
  (<a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005S22">LDC2005S22</a>), a corpus of persons speaking English syllables. Changes include the addition of forced alignment to sound files, time alignment of syllable utterances and format conversions.</p>
<p>AIC consists of 20 American English speakers (12 males, 8 females) pronouncing syllables,  some of which form actual words, but most of which are nonsense syllables. All possible Consonant-Vowel (CV) and Vowel-Consonant (VC) combinations were recorded for each speaker twice, once in isolation and once within a carrier-sentence, for a total of 25768 recorded syllables.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Articulation Index LSCP alters AIC in the following ways.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Time-alignments for the onset and offset of each word and syllable were generated  through forced-alignment with a standard HMM-GMM (Hidden Markov Model-Gaussian Mixture Model) ASR system.</li>

<li>The time-alignments for the beginning and end of the syllables (whether in isolation or within a carrier sentence) were manually adjusted. The time-alignments for the other words in carrier sentences were not manually adjusted.</li>

<li>The recordings of isolated syllables were cut according to the manual time-alignments to remove the silent portions at the beginning and end, and the time-alignments were altered to correspond to the cut recordings.
</li>
<li>The file naming scheme  was slightly altered for compatibility with the <a href="http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/">Kaldi speech recognition toolkit</a>.
</li>
<li> AIC contains a wide-band (16 KHz, 16-bit PCM) and a narrow-band (8 KHz, 8 bit u-law) version of the recordings distributed in sphere format. The LSCP version contains the wide-band version only distributed as wave files. </li>

</ol>

<p>This release does not include certain AIC triphone recordings (CVC, CCV or VCC).</p>
<p>Audio data is presented as 16kHz 16-bit flac compressed .wav files. The flac compression was added for distribution, and  documentation may  refer to the files as .wav files. </p>
