<h1>USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts Czech</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2014S04</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts Czech, LDC Catalog Number LDC2014S04 
  and ISBN 1-58563-672-X, was developed by The University of Southern California 
  Shoah Foundation Institute (<a href="http://sfi.usc.edu/">USC-SFI</a>) and 
  the <a href="http://www.zcu.cz/en/">University of West Bohemia</a> as part of the
  <a href ="http://malach.umiacs.umd.edu/">MALACH 
  (Multilingual Access to Large Spoken ArCHives) Project</a>. It contains approximately 
  229 hours of interviews from 420 interviewees along with transcripts and other 
  documentation.</p>

<p>Inspired by his experience making <i>Schindler’s List</i>, Steven Spielberg 
  established the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation in 1994 to 
  gather video testimonies from survivors and other witnesses of the Holocaust. 
  While most of those who gave testimony were Jewish survivors, the Foundation 
  also interviewed homosexual survivors, Jehovah’s Witness survivors, liberators 
  and liberation witnesses, political prisoners, rescuers and aid providers, Roma 
  and Sinti (Gypsy) survivors, survivors of eugenics policies, and war crimes 
  trials participants. Within several years, the Foundation’s Visual History Archive 
  held nearly 52,000 video testimonies in 32 languages representing 56 countries. 
  It is the largest archive of its kind in the world. In 2006, the Foundation 
  became part of the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences 
  at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and was renamed as the 
  USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education. </p>
<p>The goal of the MALACH project was to develop methods for improved access to 
  large multinational spoken archives. The focus was advancing the state of the 
  art of automatic speech recognition and information retrieval. The characteristics 
  of the USC-SFI collection -- unconstrained, natural speech filled with disfluencies, 
  heavy accents, age-related coarticulations, un-cued speaker and language switching 
  and emotional speech -- were considered well-suited for that task. The work 
  centered on five languages: English, Czech, Russian, Polish and Slovak. USC-SFI 
  MALACH Interviews and Transcripts Czech was developed for the Czech speech recognition 
  experiments. </p>
  <p>LDC has also released USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts English 
  (<a href="http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012S05">LDC2012S05</a>).</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The speech data in this release was collected beginning in 1994 under a wide 
  variety of conditions ranging from quiet to noisy (e.g., airplane overflights, 
  wind noise, background conversations and highway noise). Original interviews 
  were recorded on Sony Beta SP tapes, then digitized into a 3 MB/s MPEG-1 stream 
  with 128 kb/s (44 kHz) stereo audio. The sound files in this release are single channel
FLAC compressed PCM WAV format at a sampling frequency of 16 kHz.</p>
<p>Approximately 570 of all USC-SFI collected interviews are 
  in Czech and average approximately 2.25 hours each. The interviews 
  sessions in this release are divided into a training set (400 interviews) and 
  a test set (20 interviews). The first fifteen minutes of the second tape from 
  each training interview (approximately 30 total minutes of speech) was transcribed 
  in .trs format using <a href="http://trans.sourceforge.net/en/presentation.php">Transcriber 
  1.5.1</a>. The test interviews were transcribed completely. Thus the corpus 
  consists of 229 hours of speech (186 hours of training material plus 43 hours 
  of test data) with 143 hours transcribed (100 hours of training material plus 
  43 hours of test data). Certain
interviews include speech from family members in addition to that of the
subject and the interviewer. Accordingly, the corpus contains speech from
more than 420 speakers, who are more or less equally distributed between
males and females.</p>
