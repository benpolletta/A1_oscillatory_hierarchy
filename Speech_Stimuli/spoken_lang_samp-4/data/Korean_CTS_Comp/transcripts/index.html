    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    <p>Korean Telephone Conversations Transcripts was produced by Linguistic Data
    Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2003T08 and ISBN 1-58563-264-3.


    <p>The telephone conversations on which these transcripts are based were originally recorded as
    part of the Callfriend project. The Callfriend Korean telephone speech was
    collected by Linguistic Data Consortium primarily in support of the
    Language Identification (LID) project, sponsored by the U.S. Department of
    Defense. The calls were later transcribed for use in other projects.


    <p>This publication consists of 100 transcribed telephone conversations
    in Korean. The corresponding speech is published as <a href="
    http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003S03"
    style="text-decoration:none">Korean Telephone Conversations Speech</a>.
    The Korean orthographic forms from the 100 trascription
    files serve as the head-words in the associated <a href="
    http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003L02"
    style="text-decoration:none">Korean Telephone Conversations Lexicon</a>.

    <p>The recorded conversations are between native speakers of Korean and
    last up to 30 minutes, of which the transcribed speech covers between 15 to
    18 minutes. All speakers were aware that they were being recorded. They
    were given no guidelines concerning what they should talk about. Once a
    caller was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free choice of whom
    to call. Most participants called family members or close friends. All
    calls originated in either the United States or Canada.
