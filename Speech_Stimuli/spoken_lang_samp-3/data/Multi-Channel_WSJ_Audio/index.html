<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Multi-Channel WSJ Audio (MCWSJ), Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) Catalog Number 
  LDC2014S03 and ISBN 1-58563-674-6, was developed by The University of Edinburgh's 
  <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/">Centre for Speech Technology Research </a> 
  and contains approximately 100 hours of recorded speech from 45 British English 
  speakers. Participants read Wall Street Journal texts published in 1987-1989 
  in three recording scenarios: a single stationary speaker, two stationary overlapping 
  speakers and one single moving speaker.</p>
<p>This corpus was designed to address the challenges of speech recognition in 
  meetings, which often occur in rooms with non-ideal acoustic conditions and 
  significant background noise, and may contain large sections of overlapping 
  speech. Using headset microphones represents one approach, but meeting participants 
  may be reluctant to wear them. Microphone arrays are another option. MCWSJ supports 
  research in large vocabulary tasks using microphone arrays. The news sentences 
  read by speakers are taken from <a href="http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S24">WSJCAM0 
  Cambridge Read News</a>, a corpus originally developed for large vocabulary 
  continuous speech recognition experiments, which in turn was based on <a href="http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S6A">CSR-1 
  (WSJ0) Complete</a>, made available by LDC to support large vocabulary continuous 
  speech recognition initiatives in the 1990s. </p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p> Speakers reading news text from prompts were recorded using a headset microphone, 
  a lapel microphone and an eight-channel microphone array. In the single speaker 
  scenario, participants read from six fixed positions. Fixed positions were assigned 
  for the entire recording in the overlapping scenario. For the moving scenario, 
  participants moved from one position to the next while reading. </p>
<p>Fifteen speakers were recorded for the single scenario, nine pairs for the 
  overlapping scenario and nine individuals for the moving scenario. Each read 
  approximately 90 sentences. </p>
<p>The audio data are presented as single channel 16kHz flac compressed wav files.</p>
