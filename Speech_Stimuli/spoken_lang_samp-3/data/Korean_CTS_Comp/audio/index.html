    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    <p>Korean Telephone Conversations Speech was produced by Linguistic Data
    Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2003S03 and ISBN 1-58563-263-5.

    <p>The telephone conversations in this corpus were originally recorded as
    part of the Callfriend project. The Callfriend Korean telephone speech was collected by
    Linguistic Data Consortium primarily in support of the Language
    Identification (LID) project, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. The
    calls were later transcribed for use in other projects.


    <p>This publication consists of 100 telephone
    conversations, 49 of which were published in 1996 as <a href="
    http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC96S54"
    style="text-decoration:none">CALLFRIEND Korean</a>, while the rest of 51
    are previously unexposed calls. 

    <p>All 100 conversations  have been transcribed and are published as <a href="
    http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003T08"
    style="text-decoration:none">Korean Telephone Conversations Transcripts</a>. 

    <p>The recorded conversations are between native speakers of Korean and
    last up to 30 minutes, of which the  transcribed speech covers between 15
    to 18 minutes. All speakers were aware that they were being recorded. They
    were given no guidelines concerning what they should talk about. Once a
    caller was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free choice of whom
    to call.  Most participants called family members or close friends. All
    calls originated in either the United States or Canada.
