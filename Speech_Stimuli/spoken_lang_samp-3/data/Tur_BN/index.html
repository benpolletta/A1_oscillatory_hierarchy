<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Turkish Broadcast News Speech and Transcripts, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) 
  Catalog Number LDC2012S06 and ISBN 1-58563-614-2, was developed by <a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Content/About_BU/History.aspx">Boğaziçi 
  University</a>, Istanbul, Turkey and contains approximatley 130 hours of Voice 
  of America (VOA) Turkish radio broadcasts and corresponding transcripts. This 
  is part of a larger corpus of Turkish broadcast news data collected and transcribed 
  with the goal to facilitate research in Turkish automatic speech recognition 
  and its applications, such as speech retrieval.</p>
  
<p>The VOA material was collected between December 2006 and June 2009 using a 
  PC and TV/radio card setup. The data collected during the period 2006-2008 was 
  recorded from analog FM radio; the 2009 broadcasts were recorded from digitial 
  satellite transmissions. A quick manual segmentation and transcription approach 
  was followed.</p>  
  
  
  <p>Speech recognition and retrieval experiments using the larger corpus can be found
   in the following journal article: Ebru Arisoy, Dogan Can, Siddika Parlak, Hasim Sak, 
   and Murat Saraclar, "Turkish Broadcast News Speech and Transcripts Transcription and Retrieval,"
   IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 17(5):874-883, July 2009.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The data was recrded at 32 kHz and resampled at 16 kHz. After screening for 
  recording quality, the files were segmented, transcribed, and verified. The 
  segmentation occurred in two steps, an initial automatic segmentation followed 
  by manual correction and annotation which included information such as background 
  conditions and speaker boundaries. </p>

<p>The transcription guidelines were adapted from the LDC HUB4 and 
  quick transcription guidelines. An English version of the adapted 
  guidelines is provided with the data <a href="docs/RapidTrans.pdf">here</a>. 
  The manual segmentations and transcripts were created by native Turkish speakers 
  at Boğaziçi University using <a href="http://trans.sourceforge.net/en/presentation.php">Transcriber</a>. 
  The transcriptions are provided in the ISO-8859-9 (Latin5) character set. </p>
