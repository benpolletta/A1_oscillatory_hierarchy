<h1>The Subglottal Resonances Database</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2015S03</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Subglottal Resonances Database, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2015S03 and ISBN 1-58563-711-4, was developed by 
  <a href="https://psychweb.wustl.edu/">Washington University</a> and <a href="http://www.ee.ucla.edu/">University of California Los Angeles</a> and consists of 45 hours of 
  simultaneous microphone and subglottal accelerometer recordings of 
  25 adult male and
25 adult female speakers of American English between 22 and 25 
years of age.  </p>
<p>The subglottal system is composed of the airways of the tracheobronchial tree and the surrounding tissues. It powers airflow through the larynx and vocal tract, allowing for the generation of most of the sound sources used in  languages around the world. The subglottal resonances (SGRs) are the natural frequencies of the subglottal system. During speech, the subglottal system is acoustically coupled to the vocal tract via the larynx. SGRs can be measured from recordings of the vibration of the skin of the neck  during phonation by an accelerometer, much like speech formants are measured through microphone recordings. </p>
<p>SGRs have received attention in studies of speech production, perception and technology. They affect voice production, divide vowels and consonants into discrete categories, affect vowel perception and can be useful in automatic speech recognition.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Speakers were recruited by Washington University's Psychology Department. The majority of the participants were Washington University students who represented a wide range of American English dialects, although most  were speakers of the mid-American English dialect. </p>
<p>The corpus consists of 35 monosyllables in a phonetically neutral carrier
  phrase (“I said a ____ again”), with 10 repetitions of each word by each 
  speaker, resulting
in 17,500 individual microphone (and accelerometer) waveforms. The monosyllables were comprised of 14 hVd words and 21 CVb words where C was <em>b,d, g</em> and V included all AE	monophthongs and diphthongs. </p>
<p>The target vowel in each
  utterance was hand-labeled to indicate the start, stop, and 
  steady-state parts of the
  vowel. For diphthongs, the steady-state refers to the 
  diphthong nucleus which occurs early
in the vowel. </p>
<p>The height and age of each speaker is included in the corpus metadata. </p>
<p>Audio files are
  presented as single channel 16-bit flac compressed wav files with sample
rates of 48kHz or 16kHz. Image files  are bitmap image files and plain text is UTF-8.</p>
