    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains documentation for samples from the <font color="#000000">CALLHOME 
  Japanese collection</font>, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog numbers 
  LDC96S37 (speech) and LDC96T18 (transcripts) and isbns 1-58563-077-2 and 1-58563-078-0, 
  respectively. 
<p>CALLHOME Japanese telephone speech was collected and transcribed by LDC primarily 
  in support of the Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition (LVCSR) 
  project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. It consists of 120 unscripted 
  telephone conversations between native Japanese speakers. All speakers (callers 
  and recipients) were aware that they were being recorded and were not restricted 
  in their choice of conversation topics. Once a caller was recruited to participate 
  in the collection, he/she was given a free choice of whom to call. Most participants 
  called family members or close friends overseas. All calls originated in North 
  America. The transcripts are timestamped by speaker turn for alignment with 
  the speech signal and are provided in standard orthography.
<p>Speakers were solicited by LDC through personal contacts and the internet. 
  A total of 200 call originators were enrolled, each of whom placed a telephone 
  call via a toll-free robot operator maintained originally by Rutgers University, 
  and later by LDC. Access to the robot operator was possible via a unique Personal 
  Identification Number (PIN) issued by the recruiting staff at Rutgers or LDC 
  when the caller enrolled in the project. Each caller placed one telephone call 
  and spoke for up to 30 minutes. After a successful call was completed, a human 
  audit was conducted to verify that the proper language was spoken, to check 
  the quality of the recording, and to select and describe the region to be transcribed. 
  The description of the transcribed region provides information about channel 
  quality, number of speakers, speaker gender, and other attributes.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>

    
<p>Presented here are three approximate two-minute call samples and their associated 
  transcripts. The audio files in the full corpus are in NIST Sphere format; the 
  format for the audio samples is MS Wav format (.wav). The transcripts are encoded 
  in EUC character encoding. To esnure compatibility, the transcripts are presented 
  as both PDF and raw text.
