<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>CSC Deceptive Speech, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2013S09 
  and ISBN 1-58563-660-6, was developed by Columbia University, SRI International 
  and University of Colorado Boulder. It consists of 32 hours of audio interview 
  from 32 native speakers of Standard American English 
  (16 male,16 female) recruited from the Columbia University student population 
  and the community. The purpose of the study was to distinguish deceptive speech 
  from non-deceptive speech using machine learning techniques on extracted features 
  from the corpus.</p>
<p>The participants were told that they were participating in a communication 
  experiment which sought to identify people who fit the profile of the top entrepreneurs 
  in America. To this end, the participants performed tasks and answered questions 
  in six areas; they were later told that they had received low scores in some 
  of those areas and did not fit the profile. The subjects then participated in 
  an interview where they were told to convince the interviewer that they had 
  actually achieved high scores in all areas and that they did indeed fit the 
  profile. The interviewer's task was to determine how he thought the subjects 
  had actually performed, and he was allowed to ask them any questions other than 
  those that were part of the subjects' tasks. For each question from the interviewer, 
  subjects were asked to indicate whether the reply was true or contained any 
  false information by pressing one of two pedals hidden from the interviewer 
  under a table.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Interviews were conducted in a double-walled sound booth and recorded to digital 
  audio tape on two channels using Crown CM311A Differoid headworn close-talking 
  microphones, then downsampled to 16kHz before processing. </p>
<p>The interviews were orthographically transcribed by hand using the NIST EARS 
  transcription guidelines. Labels for local lies were obtained automatically 
  from the pedal-press data and hand-corrected for alignment, and labels for global 
  lies were annotated during transcription based on the known scores of the subjects 
  versus their reported scores. The orthographic transcription was force-aligned 
  using the SRI telephone speech recognizer adapted for full-bandwidth recordings. 
  There are several segmentations associated with the corpus: the implicit segmentation 
  of the pedal presses, derived semi-automatically; sentence-like units (EARS 
  SLASH-UNITS or SUs), which were hand labeled; intonational phrase units; and 
  the units corresponding to each topic of the interview.</p>

<p>Transcript files are in .trs format and audio files 
  are .wav presented in <a href="https://xiph.org/flac/">flac-compressed</a> form
