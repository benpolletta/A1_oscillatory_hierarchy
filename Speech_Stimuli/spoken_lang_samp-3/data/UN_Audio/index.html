<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>United Nations Proceedings Speech, Linguistic Data 
  Consortium (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2014S08 and ISBN 1-58563-693-2, was developed 
  by <a href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations</a> and contains approximately 8,500 
  hours of recorded proceedings in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and
  Spanish. The data was recorded in 2009-2012 and comes from sessions 64-66 of the 
<a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembling</a> (GA) and
<a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/first/">First Committee</a> (FC), 
and meetings 6434-6763 of the
 <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">Security Council</a>.</p>

<p>The recording system used was called the NICE System, it was a customised 
recording system by <a href="www.nice.com">NICE</a>. Starting in July of 2013 the UN
 has moved to a new recording system called MAMS (Media Asset Management System) by 
 SONY/Dalet. The recordings were done by following a daily internal circulated 
 instruction from MMS (<a href="http://www.un.org/depts/DGACM/mms.shtml">Meetings
 Management Section</a>). Most of the subjects and related information of a 
 particular meeting are published in a UN Journal which you can found in the 
 following link:  
<a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/journal.asp">http://www.un.org/en/documents/journal.asp</a></p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Data is presented either as mp3 or flac compressed wav and are 16-bit single channel files in either 22,050 or 8,000 Hz. It is organized by committee and session number, then language. The six UN 
languages are listed about and the folder labeled "Floor" indicates the mic used by 
the speaker at the time. These files may include other languages outside of the six.</p>
 <p>File naming conventions for GA and FC data are in the form of LYY_ZZ_format.format 
 and Security Council data is in the form of LYYYY_ZZ_format.format where L is a one
 letter language designation, YY is the meeting number, ZZ indicates the audio 
 segment number and format.format is the wav or mp3 designation. Note that not all 
 files are present for every language.</p>
