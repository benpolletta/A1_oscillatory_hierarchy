<h1>2009 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Test Set</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2014S06</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> 2009 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation Test Set, LDC2014S06 and ISBN 1-58563-682-7, 
  contains approximately 215 hours of conversational telephone speech and radio 
  broadcast conversation collected by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) in 
  the following 23 languages and dialects: Amharic, Bosnian, Cantonese, Creole 
  (Haitian), Croatian, Dari, English (American), English (Indian), Farsi, French, 
  Georgian, Hausa, Hindi, Korean, Mandarin, Pashto, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, 
  Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu and Vietnamese.</p>

<p>The goal of the <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/">NIST (National Institute 
  of Standards and Technology)</a> <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/lre/">Language 
  Recognition Evaluation (LRE)</a> is to establish the baseline of current performance 
  capability for language recognition of conversational telephone speech and to 
  lay the groundwork for further research efforts in the field. NIST conducted 
  language recognition evaluations in <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/lre/1996/">1996</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/lre/2003/">2003</a>, <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/lre/2005/">2005</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/lre/2007/">2007</a>. The 
  <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/lre/2009/">2009</a> evaluation 
  increased the number of target languages. Most of the test data 
  originated from multilingual Voice of America (VOA) radio broadcasts assessed 
  as being of telephone bandwidth in addition to conversational telephone speech. 
  Further information regarding this evaluation can be found in the evaluation 
  plan which is included in the documentation for this release.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p> The VOA speech data was collected by LDC in 2000 and 2001 and constitutes 
  approximately 75% of the test set. The telephone speech was taken from LDC's 
  Mixer 3 collection recorded between 2005 and 2007. </p>

<p>All test speech segments are presented as a sampled data stream in standard 
  8-bit 8-kHz &mu;-law format. Each segment is stored separately in a single channel 
  SPHERE format file. </p>
<p>The test segments contain three nominal durations of speech: 3 seconds, 10 
  seconds and 30 seconds. Actual speech durations vary, but were constrained to 
  be within the ranges of 2-4 seconds, 7-13 seconds and 23-35 seconds, respectively. 
  Non-speech portions of each segment were included in each segment so that a 
  segment contained a continuous sample of the source recording. Therefore, the 
  test segments may be significantly longer than the speech duration, depending 
  on how much non-speech was included.</p>
