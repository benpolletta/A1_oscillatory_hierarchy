0.150	10.450	Subj_001:	But you you understand that the only bioterrorism we've experienced so far is i- anthrax. And eh -- Right. And so it has not much to do with these Arabs.

5.120	7.340	Subj_003:	Right. And it -- they think it's he- homegrown. 

10.040	31.110	Subj_003:	Right. But we we don't know. I mean, you think the United States, with all their, you know, opening up and letting the eh eh the the people know, is going to turn around and go, oh, I guess we should tell you, w- we did give this, you know, to to the Arabs, you know, fifteen years ago. Of course not, you know? The- they don't want to ad- admit that they s- messed ((it)) up.

11.680	15.710	Subj_004:	{breath} 

24.900	25.625	Subj_001:	Yeah.

29.180	33.350	Subj_001:	{breath} D- Do you recall where you learned that? Because I uh eh tha- -- I ha- I had not heard that.

31.300	37.100	Subj_003:	Huh? um No, I don't. But I'll I'll look for it and see if I could find it again.

36.875	38.300	Subj_001:	Okay. Thank you.

38.190	42.140	Subj_004:	It was i- -- wasn't in the Enquirer, was it? {breath}{laugh} 

40.320	48.050	Subj_003:	I don't read the Enquirer. I look at them in the pa- -- in the the the grocery stores, but I never read them. {laugh} 

41.000	44.075	Subj_002:	{laugh} {laugh} 

45.225	45.675	Subj_002:	Mm.

48.050	53.125	Subj_002:	So you really -- you really believe that this is um some crazy American that's doing this?

53.760	64.500	Subj_003:	I think it's -- I think it's an extremist group that's trying to make us move faster and further than we want to go at this particular time. You know, t- to rally people.

64.170	64.625	Subj_002:	Mm.

64.560	105.140	Subj_004:	You know, I was thinking, uh w- the ques- -- the first question, how has it affected you? I was thinking, well it hasn't, so far at least, hasn't affected me at all. uh However, I just recalled, you know, um {lipsmack} my son likes me to send him a check once a month. {laugh} And um, there has been a lot of chaos and confusion lately. And actually, I sent him a check on November first. uh Is it November? November first. And uh, he didn't get it until yesterday. So I guess that may be an effect of bioterrorism.

80.780	84.000	Subj_002:	{laugh} {laugh}

81.525	84.825	Subj_003:	I would like you to send me a check once a month, too.

99.475	100.125	Subj_003:	Mhm.

104.390	108.550	Subj_002:	Mm. Well the mail has certainly slowed down especially in some areas. Mm.

107.650	110.775	Subj_003:	Oh, yeah. It took almost a month for me to get something.

111.025	112.800	Subj_002:	Yeah, you live in the district. Mm.

111.825	113.200	Subj_003:	In ~DC. Yeah. 

115.175	116.075	Subj_001:	Where in ~DC?

116.650	118.475	Subj_003:	um Down near American University.

118.850	120.550	Subj_001:	And and do you come up by subway?

120.690	121.225	Subj_003:	No.

122.550	143.870	Subj_001:	So I c- I commute by subway. um And the effect on me is is I see that the subways are not quite as crowded as they used to be. {breath} Mm, uh And I'm a little bit more nervous. D- you know, I guess I am a little nervous, because you know y- as you go through me- Metro Center and you {breath} look at the beautiful place and you think, you know, it would be so easy for somebody to disturb something here.

130.000	131.325	Subj_003:	Yeah, people are afraid.

130.550	130.800	Subj_002:	Mm.

135.200	135.525	Subj_002:	Mm.

135.700	136.400	Subj_003:	Mhm.

142.925	147.300	Subj_003:	Yeah, you're j- -- y- you're very -- uh lot more vulnerable. You're a lot more aware that you're vulnerable.

143.075	143.650	Subj_002:	Yeah.

145.725	146.300	Subj_002:	Mhm.

146.920	175.320	Subj_001:	But it's only a- eh a nagging fear, it's not you know any- anything else. I mean, I'm not going to change my commuting practices you know given that the l- low probability of any event. um My employer uh b- has has instituted procedures to make the mail safer, um looking for, you know, powders in in envelopes. They -- I mean, they open -- now they o- open all the mail uh before they deliver it to us, uh.

149.500	150.100	Subj_002:	Mhm.

149.725	150.275	Subj_003:	Right.

154.390	155.075	Subj_003:	Mhm.

158.050	158.650	Subj_003:	Right. 

159.275	160.675	Subj_003:	I mean I can understand that.

168.610	170.040	Subj_004:	{breath} {cough} 

169.450	170.025	Subj_002:	Mm.

172.325	172.875	Subj_003:	Right.

174.430	179.160	Subj_004:	They open your mail before they deliver i- -- uh-oh. {laugh}
